2022 compared to 2021 – Restructuring and integration costs decreased $1.7 million to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $2.6 million in the prior year. The decrease is due to personnel restructuring within the direct to investor business.

2022 compared to 2021 – Interest income and other income (expense) was expense of $2.5 million in 2022 compared to income of $6.0 million in 2021.

2022 compared to 2021 – Interest expense and other financing costs increased $19.3 million to $44.0 million in 2022 from $24.7 million in 2021.

Also contributing was a higher average interest rate over the comparable period.
