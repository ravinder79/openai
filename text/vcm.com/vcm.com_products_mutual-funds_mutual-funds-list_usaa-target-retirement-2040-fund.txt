Annualized returns















Past performance does not guarantee future results. The performance quoted represents past performance and current performance may be lower or higher. The investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. 


Returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Performance for periods greater than one year is annualized.


Fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements were in place for some or all periods shown, without which, fund performance would have been lower.


Net expense ratio reflects the contractual waiver and/or reimbursement of management fees through June 30, 2023.


High, double-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.

                        Management 












The Fund's investment objective is to provide capital appreciation and current income consistent with its current investment allocation, which is designed for investors planning to start withdrawing funds in or near the Fund's target date (2040). The Fund invests mainly in a selection of affiliated mutual funds and ETFs. The Fund's asset class mix will shift so that the Fund becomes more conservative over time. It is anticipated that at its target date, the Fund will be 35% invested in underlying funds that invest in stocks and 65% invested in funds that invest in bonds.

Carefully consider a fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the fund's prospectus or, if available, the summary prospectus, which may be obtained by visiting the Mutual Fund and ETF prospectus pages at vcm.com. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


All investing involves risk, including the potential loss of principal.


Asset allocation and diversification do not promise any level of performance or guarantee against loss of principal. 


The Fund does not provide guaranteed income, nor is the principal value of the Fund guaranteed at any time. 


The Fund will reflect the risks and incur the expenses of the underlying funds in which it invests.


The value of your investment is also subject to geopolitical risks such as wars, terrorism, environmental disasters, and public health crises; the risk of technology malfunctions or disruptions; and the responses to such events by governments and/or individual companies.


The S&P Target Date 2040 Index is designed to represent a small, style-specific derived consensus of asset class exposure and glide path for target dates up to 2040. The index is designed to help defined contribution plan sponsors screen, select, and monitor appropriate target date funds.

The information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or distributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete, or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.


The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or “star rating,” is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed- end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product’s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The Morningstar Rating does not include any adjustment for sales loads. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.


Fund performance used for the rankings reflects certain fee waivers, without which, Morningstar rankings would have been lower and Morningstar ratings may have been lower.
