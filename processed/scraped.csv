0, Strengths copy 2," Strengths copy 2. Competitive Strengths We believe we have significant competitive strengths that position us for sustained growth and shareholder value creation over the long term. Attractive Financial Profile – Our revenues are recurring in nature, as they are based on the level of client assets we manage. Most of our strategies are in asset classes that require specialized skill, are in demand and typically command attractive fee rates. With the growth of our Solutions Platform and third-party ETF model strategies, our average fee rate is likely to decline as those businesses continue to grow and represent an increasing proportion of our total AUM. Despite their lower average fee rates, by managing these competitively priced strategies on our integrated platform we can earn higher than our average margins on these products. Because we largely outsource our middle‑ and back‑office functions, as well as technology support, we have relatively minimal capital expenditure requirements. Our integrated platform allows us the ability to make investments that can benefit each Franchise and our Solutions Platform. Approximately two‑thirds of our operating expenses are variable in nature, consisting of the incentive compensation pool for employees, sales commissions, third‑party distribution costs, sub‑advising and the fees we pay to certain of our vendors. This automatic flexing of our expense base helps to support profitability throughout various market cycles. We have identified three primary net income growth drivers; (i) we grow our AUM organically through inflows into our strategies and the market appreciation of those strategies; (ii) we have a proven ability to grow via strategic and synergistic acquisitions; and (iii) we have constructed a scalable and efficient platform. Economic and Structural Alignment of Interests Promotes Ownership Culture – Through our revenue share compensation model for our Franchises and broad employee ownership, we have structurally aligned our employees’ interests with those of our clients and other shareholders and have created an ownership culture that encourages employees to act in the best interests of clients and our Company shareholders, as well as to think long term. We believe the high percentage of employee ownership creates a collective alignment with our success. Additionally, our employees invest in products managed by our Franchises and Solutions Platform, providing direct alignment with the interests of our clients. As of December 31, 2022, 68% of our employees held nearly 20% of the equity in our Company. In addition to being aligned with our financial success through their equity ownership, our current employees collectively have invested nearly $200 million in products we manage as of December 31, 2022. We directly align the compensation paid to our investment teams with the performance of their respective Franchises by structuring formula‑based revenue sharing on the products they manage. We believe that compensation based on revenue rather than profits encourages investment professionals to focus their attention on investment performance, while encouraging them to provide good client service, focus on client retention and attract new assets. We believe the formula‑based, client‑aligned nature of our revenue sharing reduces complexity and fosters a culture of transparency where Franchises understand how, and on what terms, they are being measured to earn compensation.

2,tion,"tion. Diversification Strategy We offer an array of equity, fixed income, investment models, alternative investments, closed end private funds, and solutions strategies that encompass a diverse spectrum of market capitalization segments, industry sectors, investment styles and approaches. We believe that these strategies are positioned to attract positive net flows and sustainable fee rates over the long term and provide us with a next generation investment management platform. As illustrated below, as of December 31, 2022, our current business is well diversified from multiple perspectives, including by asset class, by investment vehicle, and by Franchises and our Solutions Platform. Within individual asset classes and strategies, our Franchises employ different investment approaches. This diversification reduces the correlation between investment return streams generated by multiple Franchises investing within the same asset class. For example, we have two Franchises (Trivalent and Sophus) focused on Emerging Markets within global/non‑U.S. equity, each with a different investment approach. Trivalent’s investment team primarily focuses on quantitative analysis for stock selection, combined with some fundamental analysis. Sophus employs a front‑end quantitative screen to first rank stocks, then further applies fundamental research to make its investment decisions. Due to the differences in investment approaches, each Franchise has a different return profile for investors in different market environments while maintaining desired asset class exposure. Our multi‑channel distribution capabilities provide another degree of diversification, with approximately 34% of our AUM from direct investor clients, 37% from retail clients, and 29% from institutional clients, as of December 31, 2022. Within these channels, clients are further diversified among intermediary (broker dealer and RIAs) platforms, sub advisory relationships, corporate and public entities, insurance companies, 529 Education Saving Plan participants, Taft-Hartley plans, endowments, and Family Offices. We believe this broad diversification of customers has a stabilizing effect on revenue, as various types of investors have unique demand patterns and respond differently to trends and market cycles.

AUM in 2022, 2021 and 2020 December 31, 2022 AUM – Our total AUM at December 31, 2022 decreased by $30.7 billion, or 16.7%, to $153.0 billion from $183.7 billion at December 31, 2021, primarily driven by negative market movement and net outflows of $26.5 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. Net outflows were driven by $4.0 billion in fixed income strategies, $2.1 billion our U.S. small cap equity strategies, $1.1 billion in our U.S. large cap equity strategies, and $0.2 billion in money market and short-term strategies, partially offset by $1.9 billion in net inflows into our Solutions Platform, $1.7 billion into our alternative investment strategies, and $1.0 billion into our global/non-U.S. equity strategies. December 31, 2021 AUM – Our total AUM at December 31, 2021 increased by $36.4 billion, or 24.7%, to $183.7 billion from $147.2 billion at December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the combination of net acquired assets and positive market movement of $20.3 billion and $20.6 billion, respectively, partially offset by net outflows of $4.5 billion. The net outflows were driven by $2.2 billion in fixed income strategies, $1.8 billion our U.S. mid cap equity strategies, $1.2 billion in our U.S. large cap equity strategies, $1.1 billion in our U.S. small cap equity strategies and $0.5 billion in money market and short-term strategies, partially offset by $1.9 billion in net inflows into our Solutions Platform and $0.5 billion into our global/non-U.S. equity strategies. December 31, 2020 AUM – Our total AUM at December 31, 2020 was $147.2 billion, a decrease of $4.6 billion, or 3.0%, compared to $151.8 billion at December 31, 2019. The decrease in AUM during 2020 was due to net outflows of $19.4 billion partially offset by $14.8 billion in positive market movement. Short-term money market assets accounted for $3.5 billion, or 2.4% of the total AUM at December 31, 2020. The net outflows were driven by $8.4 billion in money market and short-term strategies, $3.5 billion in our U.S. mid cap equity strategies, $2.6 billion in our fixed income strategies, $2.1 billion in our Solutions Platform, $1.9 billion in our U.S. large cap equity strategies and $0.7 billion in our U.S. small cap equity strategies.

4,,". The conversation about global climate change prompts us to reflect on our possible contribution to this phenomenon. Even though the carbon footprint of asset managers like Victory Capital is small relative to other industries, we continue to take steps to reduce our impact on the environment. For example, 85% of our employees work in LEED certified buildings.1 In addition, one of our newly acquired Investment Franchises focuses its investments on clean energy infrastructure companies. The projects it has funded have (cumulatively through 2021) offset millions of metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalents. The greenhouse gas abatement those projects create is equivalent to planting tens of millions of trees or removing hundreds of thousands of cars from roads.   As society transitions from responding to the effects of climate change to trying to stop it, one challenge is the responsible production of key enabler commodities that underpin many sustainable products needed to help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions now and in the future. Victory Capital offers investment opportunities in structurally advantaged owners of key assets required for the successful shift to a zero-carbon future.  Dave Alt, CFA Director of ESG & Responsible Investing Victory Capital   "

8,tegy,"tegy. Our Growth Strategy We have a purposeful strategy designed to achieve continued measured profitable growth and success for our clients, our employees, and our shareholders. The growth we pursue is both organic and inorganic. Organic Growth – We seek to grow organically by offering strategies that are value-added and solution oriented to investment portfolios with strong risk-adjusted performance track records over the long term. A key driver of our growth strategy lies in enhancing the strength of our existing Franchises. We primarily do this by providing them with access to our operating platform, technology, distribution, marketing, and other support functions. Largely unencumbered by the burdens of administrative and operational tasks, our investment professionals can focus on delivering investment excellence and maintaining strong client relationships. We also help our Franchises through new product development and product packaging. We believe we are well positioned to help our Franchises grow their product offerings and diversify their client base, with the ability to offer their strategies in multiple investment vehicles to meet the unique needs of diverse clients. We continually evaluate and make investments to improve our operating platform. Recent initiatives include investments in data and analytics, technology, distribution, and marketing to enhance organic growth in our business and increase efficiencies in our distribution channels. Inorganic Growth – We supplement our organic growth through strategic acquisitions. We primarily seek to acquire investment management firms that will add high quality investment teams, enhance our growth and financial profile, improve our diversification by asset class and investment strategy, achieve our integration expectations, and expand our distribution capabilities. One of our key advantages in a competitive mergers and acquisition environment is our ability to provide access to multiple distribution channels. Our distribution and marketing platforms drive organic growth at our acquired Franchises both by opening new distribution channels and penetrating deeper into existing ones. This support received from our sales and marketing professionals allows our investment professionals to focus primarily on delivering investment excellence. Since our management‑led buyout with Crestview Partners II GP, L.P. (“Crestview GP”) from KeyCorp in 2013, we have successfully closed seven acquisitions, made and exited two minority investments, and through December 31, 2022, grown our AUM more than 750% from $17.9 billion to $153.0 billion. We understand the need to execute transactions while minimizing disruption to the investment teams and to the client experience. Our team is very experienced and has a history of success in meeting those objectives. Previous acquisitions have evolved and diversified our products resulting in a mix of compelling investment strategies in asset classes where we can be successful and earn sustainable management fees. We regularly evaluate potential acquisition candidates and maintain a strong network of industry participants and advisors who provide opportunities to establish potential target relationships and source transactions. Our management team leads and participates in our acquisition strategy, leveraging their many years of experience actively operating our Company on a day‑to‑day basis to successfully source, execute, integrate, and ultimately operate acquired businesses.

9,,". Effects of Inflation Inflation did not have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations. Inflationary pressures can result in increases to our cost structure. Certain large expense components such as compensation and distribution expenses are predominately variable and move in tandem with revenues. To the degree that these expense increases are not recoverable or cannot be counterbalanced through price increases due to the competitive environment, our profitability could be negatively impacted. In addition, the value of the fixed income assets that we manage may be negatively impacted when inflationary expectations result in a rising interest rate environment. Declines in the values of AUM could lead to reduced revenues as investment management fees are generally earned as a percentage of AUM. "

12, Strengths," Strengths. Competitive Strengths We believe we have significant competitive strengths that position us for sustained growth and shareholder value creation over the long term. Integrated Model Providing Centralized Distribution, Marketing, and Support Functions to Investment Franchises, which maintain complete Investment Autonomy – Our highly integrated model allows us to achieve benefits from both our substantial scale and the focus of our specialized investment managers. Our Franchises retain investment autonomy while benefiting from our centralized operating platform. We have demonstrated an ability to incorporate our Franchises onto our flexible infrastructure without significantly increasing incremental fixed costs, which is a key component to the scalability of our business model. This structure enables our Franchises to focus their efforts on the investment process, providing them with a scaled platform to enhance their investment performance and consequently their growth prospects. Centralized operations allow our Franchises to customize their desired investment support functions in ways that are best suited for their investment workflow. Through our unified distribution platform, our Franchises can efficiently sell their products to institutional investors, retirement plans, wealth managers, as well as through retail and retirement intermediaries of all sizes, where it can be challenging for smaller managers to gain access, and directly to investors.   Within our model, each Franchise retains its own brand and logo, which has been built over time. Unlike other models with unified branding, there is no requirement for newly acquired Franchises to adjust their product set due to pre‑existing products on our platform; they are marketed under their own brand as they were previously. Because of this dynamic, we have the flexibility to add new Franchises either to gain greater exposure to certain asset classes or increase capacity in places where we already have exposure. Proven Acquirer with Compelling Value Proposition – We believe our platform allows us to continue to be a strategic acquirer within the investment management industry, providing us with an opportunity to further grow and scale our business. Through numerous transactions, we have demonstrated an ability to successfully source, execute and integrate new Franchises. We believe our unique business model is compelling for potential acquisition prospects. Under our model, Franchises retain the brands they have built as well as autonomy over their investment decisions, while simultaneously benefiting from the ability to leverage our centralized distribution, marketing, and operations platform. Our model reduces the administrative burdens borne by our Investment Franchises and allows them instead to focus on the investment process, which we believe can enhance their investment performance. By offering a platform on which Franchises can focus on their core competencies, grow their client base faster and participate in a revenue share program, we believe we are providing an attractive proposition. Furthermore, we believe equity in Victory Capital is attractive to Franchise investment personnel, as these personnel receive the advantage of sharing in the potential upside of the entirety of our diversified investment management business.

14,ompensation,"ompensation. Personnel Compensation and Benefits 2022 compared to 2021 – Personnel compensation and benefits were $238.2 million in 2022, an increase of $3.4 million, or 1.4%, from $234.8 million in 2021 primarily due to an increase in variable costs such as sales-based compensation. Also contributing was an increase in headcount and acquisition and transaction-related compensation as a result of the WestEnd and NEC acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2021. Partially offsetting the increase was a decrease in incentive compensation as a result of a decline in operating results. Salaries, payroll related taxes and employee benefits were $87.8 million and $87.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Incentive compensation and equity awards granted to employees and directors were $94.5 million and $17.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $109.0 million and $17.6 million, respectively, for the same period in 2021. 2021 compared to 2020 – Personnel compensation and benefits were $234.8 million in 2021, an increase of $37.7 million, or 19.1%, from $197.2 million in 2020 primarily attributable to an increase in salaries, payroll related taxes and employee benefits, incentive compensation and sales-based compensation due to an increase in headcount and an increase in operating results, resulting in an increase in variable costs such as the incentive compensation pool for employees, sales commissions, and third-party distribution costs. Salaries, payroll related taxes and employee benefits were $87.1 million and $76.3 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Incentive compensation and equity awards granted to employees and directors were $109.0 million and $17.6 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $87.4 million and $18.1 million, respectively, for the same period in 2020.

Average AUM was $164.0 billion in 2022 compared to $158.6 billion in 2021. 2021 compared to 2020 – Investment management fees increased $112.5 million, or 20.0%, to $674.5 million in 2021 from $562.0 million in 2020 due to an increase in average AUM year over year, partially offset by a decrease in revenue realization due to a shift in asset class and product mix. Average AUM was $158.6 billion in 2021 compared to $136.4 billion in 2020, mostly attributable to market appreciation. Fund Administration and Distribution Fees 2022 compared to 2021 – Fund administration and distribution fees decreased $25.6 million, or 11.9%, to $190.1 million in 2022 compared to $215.7 million in 2021. The decrease is due primarily to lower mutual fund average net assets. 2021 compared to 2020 – Fund administration and distribution fees were relatively flat, increasing $2.4 million, or 1.1% to $215.7 million in 2021 compared to $213.3 million in 2020. The increase is due to an increase in fund administration fees, partially offset by a decrease in transfer agent fees and a shift in the mix of assets to lower 12b-1 paying share classes. "

(NASDAQ:VCTR) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript February 10, 2023 Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Victory Capital Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All callers are in a listen-only mode. Following the company's prepared remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Matthew Dennis, Chief of Staff and Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Dennis. Matthew Dennis: Thank you. Before I turn the call over to David Brown, I would like to remind you that during today's conference call, we may make a number of forward-looking statements. Please note that Victory Capital's actual results may differ materially from these statements. Please refer to our SEC filings for a list of some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed on today's call. Victory Capital assumes no duty and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Our press release that was issued after the market closed yesterday disclosed both GAAP and non-GAAP financial results. We believe the non-GAAP measures enhance the understanding of our business and our performance. Reconciliations between these non-GAAP measures and the most comparable GAAP measures are included in tables that can be found in our earnings press release and in the slide presentation accompanying this call, both of which are available on the Investor Relations portion of our website at ir.vcm.com. It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to David Brown, Chairman and CEO. David? David Brown: Thanks, Matt. Good morning, and welcome to Victory Capital's third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. I'm joined today by Michael Policarpo, our President, Chief Financial and Administrative Officer; as well as Matt Dennis, our Chief of Staff and Director of Investor Relations. I'll start today by providing an overview of the quarter and the full year period. Then I will cover our investment performance, which continues to be very strong. Then I will turn the call over to Mike to review the financial results in greater detail. Following our prepared remarks, Mike, Matt and I, will be available to take your questions. The quarterly business overview begins on Slide 5. 2022 was a history year for the asset management industry. The disruptions in both the equity and fixed income markets drove assets levels significantly lower across most asset classes with industry wide declines in year-over-year revenue and operating margins. While we are not immune to the market backdrop, I am very pleased with the results we reported last night. At the end of each year, I like to step back and take a long range view of our company and review our progress against our long-term strategy and goals. At the start of the year, we laid out several key strategic objectives and we have achieved tangible and measurable progress in each area. As part of that, we continue to make strategic investments in hiring, technology, data, and marketing and distribution during the year and we are seeing that these investments are beginning to pay us back. Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript A good example of this gross long-term flows in 2022 were $33.3 billion which is 20% higher than the gross long-term flows of $27.9 billion generated in 2021 and 44% higher than gross long-term flows in 2020. The $6.5 billion in gross long-term flows achieved in the fourth quarter of 2022 is a record high for any fourth quarter period in our history. These results reinforce our strategy of investing in areas where we can make a meaningful impact on our business. Our long-term net flows were negative $2.5 billion during the year which equates to only 1.4% of the beginning of the year assets under management and pales in comparison to the more than $26 billion of negative market action we experienced since the beginning of the year. Specific to the fourth quarter, net long-term outflows were elevated. We experienced clients selling assets at an accelerated pace for a number of reasons including tax loss, harvesting, capital gain, distribution avoidance, and pivoting to risk off positions to name a few. To-date in 2023 our net long-term flows have improved materially across our business from the fourth quarter. Operating income rose 7% from $374 million in 2021 to $399 million in 2022. Full year adjusted EBITDA margin was 49.6% in 2022 which exceeded our long-term guidance of 49% and is a good representation of our margin defensibility during a very volatile year. Adjusted net income or tax benefit was $1.05 per dilute share in the quarter and $4.58 per diluted share for all of 2022. We continue to return capital to our shareholders in 2022. Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript We were opportunistic in our share repurchases which accelerated in the second half of the year. In total we returned more than $200 million of capital to shareholders, which was more than three times the $62 million in capital returned in 2021. At the same time, we continued to reduce debt to increase our balance sheet flexibility. Based on our positive outlook of excess cash flow generation, the Board declared an increase of 28% in our quarterly cash dividend this quarter. Additionally, we have continued to make investments in our business in areas that can have the greatest impacts. These included expanding the use of data in all aspects of our business, enhancing our technology capabilities, investing in distribution, marketing, continuing to hire new talent, as well as expanding the products and service offerings available for our direct investors. While many in the industry are cutting their capital allocated to invest in their platform and people, we are not. We are continuing to invest and hire at the same steady pace we have maintained over the last few years, and we'll do the same thing in 2023 while also maintaining our long-term adjusted EBITDA margin guidance of 49%. Turning to Slide 7, you can see the strong investment performance we deliver on behalf of our clients has continued throughout the year and its final quarter. We had 44 mutual funds and ETFs with four or five star overall ratings from Morningstar. These products with four or five stars account for 62% of our AUM in mutual funds and ETFs. Additionally, approximately 80% of our total AUM outperformed benchmarks for the three, five, and 10-year measurement periods as of yearend. During the year, our WestEnd Advisors franchise secured new platform placements with seven firms. In addition, we experienced more than a 25% increase of new advisors opening their first account with WestEnd during New Year. This sets the foundation for solid organic growth as these new advisors expand the number of underlying clients utilizing WestEnd's models. 2023 is also off to a strong start with three of WestEnd's products being added to LPL's Model Wealth Portfolios platform, which is the flagship platform for many LPL advisors. We are also very well positioned from an investment performance and distribution standpoint to benefit from rotation back into fixed income. The increased shelf space we have secured for our USAA investments franchise outperforming fixed income products over the last few years, has us very well positioned to capture more market share as investors reallocate back to fixed income. Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript Keep in mind, from a product offering perspective, we have mutual funds, separate accounts, and the ETFs available for this franchise. Turning to Slide 8. Cash flow generation remained strong during the fourth quarter and full year. Share repurchases totaled 4.6 million shares during the year, which was significantly higher than in prior years. We pivoted to allocating more of our excess free cash flow to share repurchases given equity market conditions, and specifically due to the price of VCTR. Additionally, we did continue to reduce debt and we maintained our growing ancillary cash dividend. The chart on the right of this slide illustrates respective full year 2022 capital allocations. Our strategy included deploying capital support, earnings growth, capital appreciation, and balance sheet flexibility, while at the same time rewarding shareholders with capital returns. We intend to maintain flexibility and strategically allocate excess capital to maximize long-term shareholder value creation. As we continue to conduct diligence on acquisition opportunities, we remain patient and selective. This approach has served us well over time. We are continuing to evaluate a number of opportunities and believe our patience and hard work will yield a positive outcome for our business and for our shareholders. Lastly, subsequent to year end, we announce a new addition to our corporate board. We welcomed Vice Admiral Mary Jackson as a new independent director of the company. Vice Admiral Jackson retired after serving the United States Navy for more than three decades. We look forward to her leadership and contributions to the Board. With that, I will turn it over to Mike for more details on the quarter's financials. Mike? Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript Michael Policarpo: Thanks Dave and good morning everyone. The financial results review begins on Slide 10. Total AUM increased $5.7 billion or 4% in the quarter to $153 billion at the end of December. This was driven by more than $10 billion of positive market actions as the markets rebounded during the quarter. Revenue of $201 million in the fourth quarter was up 3% in the third quarter, which was consistent with the 3% decline in average AUM in the year's final quarter despite the higher point-to-point AUM. Full year 2022 revenue was $855 million. On a GAAP basis our operating income was $79.6 million in the fourth quarter and $399 million for the full year period. This compares with $89.8 million in the same quarter last year, and $374 million for all of 2021. The increase in year-over-year operating income is attributable to non-cash items, namely the change in value of contingent consideration for recent acquisitions. Adjusted EBITDA was $100 million in the fourth quarter and $424 million for the year. Our margins have held up better than most all companies in our sector. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 49.7% in the quarter and 49.6% in the full year. Adjusted net income with tax benefit was $74.5 million or $1.05 per diluted share in the fourth quarter and $331.2 million or $4.58 per diluted share for the full year. Looking at capital allocation, we returned a record amount of capital to shareholders during the year. In the fourth quarter, we returned $59 million to shareholders with $42 million of that through share repurchases and $17 million in dividends. Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript Lastly, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 28% to $0.32 per share, and that will be payable on March 27th to shareholders of record on March 10th. On Slide 11, you can see total AUM of $153 billion at the end of the year remains well diversified from a distribution channel and client perspective. This diversification has served us well in the current volatile market environment. Turning to Slide 12, long-term gross flows were $6.5 billion in the fourth quarter, which was the highest we've ever reported for a fourth quarter period. Full year gross long-term flows of $33.3 billion, also marked a new record. WestEnd Advisors, Sycamore, Sophus, and RS Global, each had positive net flows for 2022 and the fourth quarter represented the ninth consecutive quarter of positive net flows for our Victory Shares ETF business. Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript We also earned a number of product recommendations and model allocations during 2022 that will support future sales activity. For example, Fidelity Strategic Advisors and Edward Jones made model allocations to trivalent and RS growth respectively and Schwab added the Victory shares USAA core intermediate term bond ETF to one of its models. In addition, our market neutral income fund was added to the recommended lists at Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch, Saterra , Fifth Third Bank and LPL. And this was added to models at both Fidelity and LPL. Slide 13 illustrates our revenue by quarter. One note to make on this slide is our fee rate held up nicely and was 51.7 basis points in the quarter. On Slide 14, we break out our expenses which increased $10.5 million due primarily to an increase in non-cash expense related to the change in value of contingent consideration from recent acquisitions recorded in acquisition, restructuring and integration expenses. On a cash basis, compensation as a percentage of revenue held steady as designed at 24.5% and our variable operating expenses calibrated with our AUM and revenue. Moving on to our non-GAAP results on Slide 15, adjusted net income was $65 million in the fourth quarter. The tax benefit in the quarter increased to $9.5 million, reflecting the incremental tax benefit associated with the payment of the third USAA earnout payment of $37.5 million made in Q4. ANI with tax benefit was $74.5 million or $1.05 per diluted share. Our adjusted EBITDA margin came in very strong at 49.7% in the quarter. We're making no changes in maintaining our long-term guidance of 49% for 2023, which is inclusive of our continued investments in numerous areas to support our growth initiatives that Dave highlighted in his opening remarks. Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript Lastly, turning to Slide 16, our net leverage ratio at year end was 2.4 times. We reduced debt by $150 million during the year through repayments and purchases in the open market. As a reminder, we are reducing the floating portion of our debt and not the $450 million of debt that we have hedged at 3.15% interest rate. In addition, our $100 million revolver remains undrawn. GAAP operating cash flow from operations was $67.1 million in the fourth quarter. That concludes our prepared remarks. I will now turn it back over to the operator for questions. "
17,,". Spurs Sports & Entertainment (SS&E) and Victory Capital Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: VCTR) (“Victory Capital”) today announced a multi-year naming rights partnership with Victory Capital Management Inc. for the team’s new performance center being constructed at The Rock at La Cantera.

18,,". Human Capital Our senior management team, Franchises’ CIOs and sales leaders are highly experienced in the industry, each bringing significant expertise to his or her role, having tenures on average of more than 20 years. As an asset management firm, we are in the human capital business. As such, we value and appreciate our most important asset—our people. We employ “owners,” not employees. Accordingly, we strive to offer competitive compensation and employee benefits to all employees. We want them to own their contribution to Victory Capital’s success. In recognition of this mission, Victory Capital has established an equity awards program that most employees participate in. As of December 31, 2022, we had 512 employees, with 68% holding ownership interests in our Company that totaled nearly 20% of the equity in our firm. Our employees also held approximately $200 million of their personal assets in our investment products at year-end. We believe that doing our part to maintain the health and welfare of our employees is a critical element for achieving commercial success. As such, we provide our employees with comprehensive health benefits and offer a wellness program which focuses on employee health strategies and includes a discount to employee medical premiums for the completion of certain wellness initiatives. In addition, we offer employee assistance programs, including confidential assistance for financial, mental, and physical well-being. Finally, the well-being of our employees is enhanced when they can give back to their local communities or charities and we have programs that encourage our employees to give back to their local communities. "

20,compliance,"compliance. Regulatory Environment and Compliance Our business is subject to extensive regulation in the United States at the federal level and, to a lesser extent, the state level, as well as regulation by self‑regulatory organizations, and outside the United States. Under these laws and regulations, agencies that regulate investment advisers have broad administrative powers, including the power to limit, restrict or prohibit an investment adviser from carrying on its business in the event that it fails to comply with such laws and regulations. Possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain lines of business for specified periods of time, revocation of investment adviser registration and other registrations, censures, and fines. SEC Investment Adviser and Investment Company Registration / Regulation – VCM and WestEnd are both registered with the SEC as investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), and the Victory Funds, USAA Funds, VictoryShares and several of the investment companies we sub‑advise are registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”). The Advisers Act and the 1940 Act, together with the SEC’s regulations and interpretations thereunder, impose substantive and material restrictions and requirements on the operations of advisers and registered funds. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the 1940 Act, ranging from fines and censures to termination of an adviser’s registration. As an investment adviser, we have a fiduciary duty to our clients. The SEC has interpreted that duty to impose standards, requirements, and limitations on, among other things: trading for proprietary, personal and client accounts; allocations of investment opportunities among clients; our use of soft dollars; execution of transactions; and recommendations to clients. We manage accounts for clients on a discretionary basis, with authority to buy and sell securities for each portfolio, select broker‑dealers to execute trades and negotiate brokerage commission rates. In connection with certain of these transactions, we receive soft dollar credits from broker‑dealers that have the effect of reducing certain of our expenses. All our soft dollar arrangements are intended to be within the safe harbor provided by Section 28(e) of the Exchange Act. If our ability to use soft dollars were reduced or eliminated as a result of the implementation of statutory amendments or new regulations, our operating expenses would increase. In addition, we also advise clients on a non-discretionary basis where we provide actively managed models using non-proprietary products. This is often referred to as assets under advisement. As registered investment advisers, VCM and WestEnd are subject to many additional requirements that cover, among other things: disclosure of information about our business to clients; maintenance of written policies and procedures; maintenance of extensive books and records; restrictions on the types of fees we may charge; custody of client assets; client privacy; advertising; and solicitation of clients. The SEC has authority to inspect any investment adviser and typically inspects a registered adviser periodically to determine whether the adviser is conducting its activities (i) in accordance with applicable laws, (ii) in a manner that is consistent with disclosures made to clients and (iii) with adequate systems and procedures to ensure compliance. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 81% of our total revenues were derived from our services to investment companies registered under the 1940 Act—i.e., mutual funds and ETFs. The 1940 Act imposes significant requirements and limitations on a registered fund, including with respect to its capital structure, investments, and transactions. While we exercise broad discretion over the day‑to‑day management of the business and affairs of the Victory Funds, USAA Funds, VictoryShares and the investment portfolios of the Victory Funds, USAA Funds, and VictoryShares and the funds we sub‑advise, the funds are subject to oversight of and governance by each fund’s board of directors. Under the 1940 Act, a majority of the directors of our registered funds must not be “interested persons” with respect to us (sometimes referred to as the “independent director” requirement) in order to rely on certain exemptive rules under the 1940 Act relevant to the operation of registered funds. The responsibilities of the fund’s board include, among other things: approving our investment advisory agreement with the fund (or, for sub‑advisory arrangements, our sub‑advisory agreement with the fund’s investment adviser); approving other service providers; determining the method of valuing assets; and monitoring transactions involving affiliates. Our investment advisory agreements with these funds may be terminated by the funds on not more than 60 days’ notice and are subject to annual renewal by the fund’s board after the initial term of one to two years. The 1940 Act also imposes on investment advisers or sub‑advisers to a registered fund a fiduciary duty with respect to the receipt of the advisers’ investment management fees or the sub-advisers’ sub‑advisory fees. That fiduciary duty may be enforced by the SEC, by administrative action or by litigation by investors in the fund pursuant to a private right of action. As required by the Advisers Act, our investment advisory agreements may not be assigned without the client’s consent. Under the 1940 Act, investment advisory agreements with registered funds (such as the mutual funds and ETFs we manage) terminate automatically upon assignment. The term “assignment” is broadly defined and includes direct assignments as well as assignments that may be deemed to occur upon the transfer, directly or indirectly, of a “controlling block” of our outstanding voting securities. Refer to “Risk Factors—Business Risks—An assignment could result in termination of our investment advisory agreements to manage SEC‑registered funds and could trigger consent requirements in our other investment advisory agreements.” SEC Broker‑Dealer Registration / FINRA Regulation – VCS is subject to regulation by the SEC, FINRA and various states. In addition, certain of our employees are registered with FINRA and such states and subject to SEC, state and FINRA regulation. The failure of these companies and/or employees to comply with relevant regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business. SEC Transfer Agent Registration – VCTA is a SEC-registered transfer agent. Our registered transfer agent is subject to the 1934 Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. These laws and regulations generally grant the SEC and other supervisory bodies broad administrative powers to address non-compliance with regulatory requirements. Sanctions that may be imposed for non-compliance with these requirements include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on engaging in certain activities for specified periods of time or for specified types of clients, the revocation of registrations, other censures, and significant fines. ERISA‑Related Regulation – We are a fiduciary under Employee Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) with respect to assets that we manage for benefit plan clients subject to ERISA. ERISA, the regulations promulgated thereunder, and applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code impose certain duties on persons who are fiduciaries under ERISA, prohibit certain transactions involving ERISA plan clients and impose monetary penalties for violations of these prohibitions. The duties under ERISA require, among other obligations, that fiduciaries perform their duties solely in the interests of ERISA plan participants and beneficiaries. CFTC Regulation – VCM is registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”) as a commodity operator and is a member of the National Futures Association (“NFA”), a self‑regulatory organization for the U.S. derivatives industry. In addition, certain of our employees are registered with the CFTC and members of NFA. Registration with the CFTC and NFA membership subjects VCM to regulation by the CFTC and the NFA including, but not limited to, reporting, recordkeeping, disclosure, self‑examination and training requirements. Registration with the CFTC also subjects VCM to periodic on‑site audits. Each of the CFTC and NFA is authorized to institute proceedings and impose sanctions for violations of applicable regulations. Non‑U.S. Regulation – In addition to the extensive regulation to which we are subject in the United States, we are subject to regulation internationally. Our business also is subject to the rules and regulations of the countries in which we market our funds or services and conduct investment activities. In Singapore, we are subject to, among others, the Securities and Futures Act (“SFA”), the Financial Advisers Act (“FAA”), and the subsidiary legislation promulgated pursuant to these acts, which are administered by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”). We and our employees conducting regulated activities specified in the SFA and/or the FAA are required to be licensed with the MAS. Failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations, codes, directives, notices, and guidelines issued by the MAS may result in penalties including fines, censures and the suspension or revocation of licenses granted by the MAS. VCM is also authorized by the Central Bank of Ireland, which regulates our Irish business activities, to act as an investment manager to Irish UCITS fund. We have historically operated in Australia based on a “sufficient equivalence relief” exemption from local licensing with the Australian Securities and Investments commission. In 2021, we applied for a Foreign Australian Financial Services License which was granted on June 15, 2021. Compliance – Our legal and compliance functions consist of 13 professionals as of December 31, 2022. This group is responsible for all legal and regulatory compliance matters, as well as for monitoring adherence to client investment guidelines. Our legal and compliance teams work through a well‑established reporting and communication structure to ensure we have a consistent and holistic program for legal and regulatory compliance. Senior management also is involved at various levels in all these functions. We cannot assure that our legal and compliance functions will be effective to prevent all losses. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors— General Risks — If our techniques for managing risk are ineffective, we may be exposed to material unanticipated losses.” For more information about our regulatory environment, refer to “Risk Factors — Legal and Regulatory Risks — As an investment management firm, we are subject to extensive regulation” and “Risk Factors — Legal and Regulatory Risks —The regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to continual change and regulatory developments designed to increase oversight may materially adversely affect our business.” "

Products and Investment Performance As of December 31, 2022, our 12 Franchises and Solutions Platform offered 128 investment strategies with the majority consisting of fixed income, U.S. small‑ and mid‑cap equities, global/non‑U.S. equities and solutions. These asset classes collectively comprised 88% of our $153.0 billion of total AUM, and 90% of long-term AUM, as of December 31, 2022. Product Mix – Our investment strategies are offered through actively and passively managed mutual funds, rules-based and active ETFs, institutional separate accounts, VIPs, ESG and impact investment strategies, alternative investments, private closed end funds, and a 529 Education Savings Plan. Victory Capital’s strategies are sold directly to investors as well as through third-party investment products, including mutual funds, third-party ETF model strategies, retail SMAs and UMAs through wrap account programs, CITs, and UCITs.. Our product mix could expand, as we can add investment vehicles to strategies offered by our Franchises. Investment Performance – Our Franchises have established a long track record of benchmark‑relative outperformance, including prior to their acquisition by us. As of December 31, 2022, 79% of our strategies by AUM had returns in excess of their respective benchmarks over a ten‑year period, 79% over a five‑year period, 84% over a three‑year period, and 54% over a one-year period. On an equal‑weighted basis, 67% of our strategies have outperformed their benchmarks over a ten‑year period, 63% over a five‑year period, 70% over a three‑year period, and 59% over a one-year period. We consider both the AUM‑weighted and equal‑weighted metrics in evaluating our investment performance. The advantage of the AUM‑weighted metric is that it reflects the investment performance of our Company as a whole, indicating whether we tend to outperform our benchmarks for the assets we manage. The disadvantage is that the metric fails to capture the overall effectiveness of our individual investment strategies; it does not capture whether most of our strategies tend to outperform their respective benchmarks. Conversely, the equal‑weighted metric reflects the overall effectiveness of our individual investment strategies but fails to capture the investment performance of our Company as a whole. A high percentage of our mutual fund and ETF assets have four- or five-star Morningstar ratings. As of December 31, 2022, 44 of our Victory Capital mutual funds and ETFs, with Morningstar overall ratings, earned ratings of four or five stars overall and 62% of our mutual fund and ETF AUM were rated four or five stars overall by Morningstar. Over a three‑year and five‑year basis, 52% and 58% of our fund AUM achieved four- or five-star ratings, respectively."
23,els,"els. Victory have three business channels/units: Direct Investor Business, Institutional Sales business, Retail Sales business. Details below. Direct Investor Business – In 2020, we launched a new digital platform to directly serve investors which features a client-centric modern design. Visitors to the site are presented with channel-specific content, useful investment tools and calculators, and timely investment insights from the Company’s investment experts. At our direct investor business contact center, we have approximately 170 sales and service professionals focused on assisting our direct investors (the “Investors”). They engage with thousands of Investors everyday via phone, chat or email depending on the Investor’s preference.

Through these interactions we provide Investors with account servicing, portfolio reviews, college planning assistance and investment guidance at no additional cost to the Investor. Many of our direct investor business contact center professionals are Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) licensed, so they are well qualified to serve the Investors’ investment needs. During the early part of the second quarter of 2023, the Direct Investor Business will be expanded to include brokerage capabilities through our broker-dealer entity VCS. Investors will be able to leverage our open architecture brokerage option and establish brokerage accounts to invest in mutual funds and ETFs from our platform along with individual stocks and products managed by third-party providers including cash management capabilities.

25,,". 2021 Debt Repricing On February 18, 2021, the Company entered into the Second Amendment (the “Second Amendment”) to the 2019 Credit Agreement with the other loan parties thereto, Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent, and the Royal Bank of Canada as fronting bank. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company repriced the existing term loans with replacement term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $755.7 million (the “Repriced Term Loans”). The Repriced Term Loans have substantially the same terms as the previously existing term loans, including the same maturity date of July 2026, except that the Repriced Term Loans provided for a reduced applicable margin on LIBOR of 25 basis points. After the Second Amendment, the applicable margin on LIBOR under the Repriced Term Loans was 2.25%. 2021 Incremental Term Loans On December 31, 2021, the Company entered into the Third Amendment (the “Third Amendment”) to the 2019 Credit Agreement with the guarantors party thereto, Barclays Bank PLC, as administrative agent, and the lenders party thereto from time to time. Pursuant to the Third Amendment, the Company obtained incremental term loans (the “2021 Incremental Term Loans”) in an aggregate principal amount of $505.0 million and used the proceeds to fund the WestEnd Acquisition and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection therewith. The 2021 Incremental Term Loans mature in December 2028 and bear interest at an annual rate equal to, at the option of the Company, either LIBOR (adjusted for reserves and subject to a 50 basis point floor) plus a margin of 2.25% or an alternate base rate plus a margin of 1.25%. Original issue discount was $2.5 million for the 2021 Incremental Term Loans. The Company incurred a total of $9.1 million of other third party costs related to the 2021 Incremental Term Loans, which were recorded as term loan debt issuance costs. 2022 LIBOR to Term SOFR Rate Transition On September 23, 2022, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the 2019 Credit Agreement to change the interest rate on the Repriced Term Loans and 2021 Incremental Term Loans from LIBOR to a rate based on SOFR plus a ten-basis point credit spread adjustment. There was no change to the applicable margin on the referenced rate as a result of the Fourth Amendment. The LIBOR rate loans outstanding as of the Fourth Amendment’s effective date continued as LIBOR rate loans until the end of their then current interest periods. The 2021 Incremental Term Loans converted into Term SOFR loans on September 30, 2022, while the Repriced Term Loans converted into Term SOFR loans on October 6, 2022. Also on October 6, 2022, the interest periods for the Repriced Term Loans and 2021 Incremental Term Loans were aligned and the three-month Term SOFR rate was elected for all the Company’s term loans. 2020 Swap Transaction On March 27, 2020, the Company executed a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap transaction (“Swap”) to effectively fix the interest rate at 3.465% on $450 million of its outstanding Term Loan through the Term Loan maturity date of July 2026. Pursuant to the Second Amendment, the Company lowered the spread on the Term Loan by 0.25% resulting in a new fixed rate of 3.215% on the $450 million of Term Loan subject to the Swap. On September 26, 2022, the Company and the Swap counterparty executed an amendment to the Swap (“the Swap Amendment”) to update LIBOR conventions to SOFR conventions and to modify the fixed rate for the change from three-month LIBOR to three-month Term SOFR effective on October 6, 2022. There was no change to the $450 million notional value, the July 1, 2026 expiration date, the quarterly payment frequency or the designated three-month maturity from the Swap Amendment. The interest rate effectively fixed by the Swap on $450 million of the Company’s outstanding term loan debt through July 1, 2026 changed from 3.215% to 3.149% as a result of the Swap Amendment. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the $450 million notional value Swap had a fair value of $46.9 million and $7.8 million, respectively, which was included in other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized income, net of tax, of $29.7 million and $13.5 million, respectively, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).

The agreements, which end in 2033, grant the Company exclusive naming rights, sponsorship, signage, advertising and other promotional rights and benefits for the new performance center.   Payments made under the agreements are deferred and expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement. The related advertising and marketing expense is recorded in general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The balance of amounts paid less amortized expense are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other assets when cumulative payments exceed amortized expense and in other liabilities when amortized expense exceeds cumulative payments.

SHARE‑BASED COMPENSATION Equity Incentive Plans Prior to the Company’s IPO in 2018, equity-based awards were issued to executives, directors and key employees of the Company under the Victory Capital Holdings, Inc. Equity Incentive Plan (the “2013 Plan”) and the Outside Director Equity Incentive Plan (the “Director Plan”). In connection with the IPO, the Company’s board of directors adopted, and the Company’s stockholders approved, the Victory Capital Holdings, Inc. 2018 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”), and the Victory Capital Holdings, Inc. 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP Plan”), each of which became effective upon the completion of the IPO. No further grants will be made under the 2013 Plan. The 2018 Plan authorizes the grant of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance awards and other awards that may be settled in or based upon shares of the Company’s Common Stock. A total of 3,372,484 of Common Stock is available for issuance under the 2018 Plan, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company’s board of directors. Shares underlying awards that are settled in cash, expire or are canceled, forfeited or otherwise terminated without delivery to a participant will again be available for issuance under the 2018 Plan. In addition, shares withheld or surrendered in connection with the payment of an exercise price of an award or to satisfy tax withholding will again be available for issuance under the 2018 Plan. As of December 31, 2022, 1,077,591 shares of Common Stock remained available for issuance under the 2018 Plan. The Compensation Committee of the Company’s board of directors approves the terms and conditions for offerings under the ESPP Plan. A total of 350,388 shares of Common Stock was available for issuance under the ESPP Plan. As of December 31, 2022, 316,905 shares of Common Stock remained available for issuance under the ESPP Plan. Under the Company’s approved offerings under the ESPP Plan, shares of Common Stock are available for purchase at three month calendar intervals at a 5 percent discount from the market price on the purchase date, which is the last day of each calendar quarter during the six month offering period. Amounts purchased by an individual cannot exceed $25,000 worth of stock in any given calendar year. The ESPP Plan is a non-compensatory plan and includes no option features other than employees may change their contributions or withdraw from the plan once during each six month offering period during a specified time approved by the Company. All U.S.-based employees are eligible to participate in the ESPP. Grant Activity In 2022, the company issued grants for 655,542 restricted shares of Common Stock under the 2018 Plan. The 2022 grants included grants for 41,587 restricted shares of Common Stock that were fully vested on the grant date, grants for 3,108 restricted shares of Common Stock that vest over 33 months, 449,113 restricted shares of Common Stock that vest over two years, 158,051 restricted shares of Common Stock that vest over three years, and 3,683 restricted shares that vest based on performance conditions.

No stock option awards were issued in 2020. Share‑based compensation expense for equity awards is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and recognized over the requisite employee service period. Stock option awards have a ten year contractual life. The Company uses the Common Stock closing price on the grant date as the grant date fair value of restricted share awards. For stock option awards, the grant date fair value of stock option awards is computed using Black‑Scholes option pricing framework. Share-based Compensation Expense The Company recorded $17.8 million, $17.6 million and $18.1 million of share-based compensation expense related to the 2018 Plan and 2013 Plan in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Share-based compensation expense is recorded in personnel compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The related tax benefits were $4.3 million for 2022 and 2021 and $4.5 million for 2020. As of December 31, 2022, the Company expects to recognize total share-based compensation expense of $16.4 million over a weighted average period of 1.3 years. The total fair value of restricted share awards vested during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $24.2 million, $45.2 million, and $20.8 million respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of stock options currently exercisable at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $52.4 million, $152.0 million and $117.1 million, respectively. NOTE 17. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS The Company maintains a defined contribution 401(k) Plan (the “401(k) Plan”), covering substantially all employees who have met the eligibility requirements. The 401(k) Plan is subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. In 2022, 2021 and 2020 the Company recognized expense of $4.8 million, $4.0 million and $4.7 million in employer matched contributions, respectively. The Company sponsors a deferred compensation plan for key investment professionals and executives (“Employee DC Plan”) as a means to reward and motivate them. The Company purchases mutual funds as directed by the plan participants to fund its related obligations. Such securities are held in a rabbi trust for the participants, and under the terms of the trust agreement, the assets of the trust are available to satisfy the claims of the Company’s general creditors in the event of bankruptcy. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company created a deferred compensation plan for non-employee members of our board of directors (the “Director DC Plan”). Benefits payable under the Director DC Plan are payable from the Company’s general assets. Amounts contributed under the Director DC Plan and earnings on those amounts are subject to the claims of the Company’s general creditors. Gains and losses from fluctuations in value of deferred compensation plan investments are included in interest income and other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and are offset entirely by the corresponding changes in value of the deferred compensation liability. Changes in the value of the Employee DC Plan and Director DC Plan liabilities are recorded in personnel compensation and benefits and general and administrative expense, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Investments held under both deferred compensation plans are recorded in deferred compensation plan investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  "

32,st2,"st2. Restructuring and Integration Costs 2022 compared to 2021 – Restructuring and integration costs decreased $1.7 million to $0.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to $2.6 million in the prior year. The decrease is due to personnel restructuring within the direct to investor business. 2021 compared to 2020 – Restructuring and integration costs decreased $5.2 million, or 66.9%, to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $7.8 million in the prior year. The decrease is due to higher integration and conversion costs associated with the USAA AMCO Acquisition recorded in 2020 compared to personnel restructuring costs within the direct investor business recorded in 2021. Interest Income and Other Income (Expense) 2022 compared to 2021 – Interest income and other income (expense) was expense of $2.5 million in 2022 compared to income of $6.0 million in 2021. The decrease was due to decrease in the net unrealized fair value of deferred compensation plan investments in 2022 compared to an increase in dividend income and unrealized gains on deferred compensation plan investments in 2021. 2021 compared to 2020 – Interest income and other income (expense) was income of $6.0 million in 2021, compared to income of $3.7 million in 2020. The increase was due to an increase in dividend income and unrealized gains on deferred compensation plan investments over the comparable period. Interest Expense and Other Financing Costs 2022 compared to 2021 – Interest expense and other financing costs increased $19.3 million to $44.0 million in 2022 from $24.7 million in 2021. The expense increase is primarily due to an increase in interest expense as a result of a higher debt principal balance resulting from our incremental borrowing in December 2021 to fund the WestEnd Acquisition. Also contributing was a higher average interest rate over the comparable period. 2021 compared to 2020 – Interest expense and other financing costs decreased by $12.4 million, or 33.4%, to $24.7 million in 2021, from $37.0 million in 2020. The expense decrease is primarily due to a decrease in interest expense as a result of a lower debt principal balance and a lower average interest rate over the comparable period. "
33,es,"es. Distribution and Other Asset‑based Expenses 2022 compared to 2021 – Distribution and other asset‑based expenses are primarily based on AUM. Distribution and other asset-based expenses decreased $15.3 million, or 8.7%, to $161.1 million in 2022 compared to $176.4 million in 2021, primarily due to a change in vehicle mix and our underlying distribution platforms. 2021 compared to 2020 – Distribution and other asset‑based expenses are primarily based on AUM. Distribution and other asset-based expenses were relatively flat, increasing $0.7 million, or 0.4%, to $176.4 million in 2021 compared to $175.7 million in 2020, primarily due to an increase in broker dealer distribution fees as a result of higher average AUM over the comparable period offset by a change in asset mix of our underlying retail distribution platforms. General and Administrative Expenses 2022 compared to 2021 – General and administrative expenses were $52.4 million in 2022 compared to $53.7 million in 2021. The decrease of $1.3 million, or 2.5%, was primarily due to decreases in technology and professional fees. 2021 compared to 2020 – General and administrative expenses were $53.7 million in 2021 compared to $51.2 million in 2020. The increase of $2.5 million, or 4.9%, was primarily due to increases in technology and professional fees partially offset by a reduction in transition service agreement costs related to the USAA AMCO Acquisition, which ended in the fourth quarter of 2020.

On September 23, 2022, the Company entered into the Fourth Amendment (the “Fourth Amendment”) to the 2019 Credit Agreement to change the interest rate on the Repriced Term Loans and 2021 Incremental Term Loans from LIBOR to a rate based on SOFR plus a ten-basis point credit spread adjustment. There was no change to the applicable margin on the referenced rate as a result of the Fourth Amendment. Refer to Note 4, Acquisitions, for further information on the USAA AMCO and WestEnd Acquisitions and Note 11, Debt, for additional information on the Company’s debt structure. NOTE 2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Basis of Presentation The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). On November 19, 2021, the Company’s stockholders voted on and approved the Amendment eliminating the Company’s dual-class stock structure. Upon the filing of the Amendment on November 23, 2021, all the shares of Class B common stock were converted into an equal number of shares of Class A common stock and the Company’s Class A common stock was renamed as “Common Stock.” All references within this document to Class A common stock for periods prior to November 23, 2021 have been updated for the renaming. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the operations of the Company and its wholly‑owned subsidiaries, after elimination of all significant intercompany transactions and balances. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. The Company evaluates entities in which it invests and investment funds that it sponsors to determine whether the Company has a controlling financial interest in these entities and is required to consolidate them. A controlling financial interest generally exists if (i) the Company holds greater than 50% voting interest in entities controlled through voting interests or if (ii) the Company has the ability to direct significant activities of a fund not controlled through voting interests (a variable interest entity or VIE) and the obligation to absorb losses of and/or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company’s involvement with non‑consolidated sponsored investment funds that are considered VIEs include providing investment advisory, fund administration, fund compliance, fund transfer agent, fund distribution services and other management services and/or holding a minority interest. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company's investments in and maximum risk of loss related to unconsolidated sponsored VIE investment funds totaled $25.3 million and $29.6 million, respectively which are included in investments in proprietary funds and deferred compensation plan investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company has not provided financial support to these entities outside the ordinary course of business, which includes assuming operating expenses of funds for competitive or contractual reasons through fee waivers and fund expense reimbursements. The Company does not consolidate the sponsored investment funds in which it has an equity investment as it holds a minority interest, does not direct significant activities of these funds and does not have the right to receive benefits nor the obligation to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to these funds. Upon the completion of the NEC Acquisition on November 1, 2021, VCM became the manager of certain general partner entities associated with the NEC Funds. The Company has no equity investment in these general partner entities, which are non-consolidated VIEs, nor in the NEC Funds and has no share of these general partner entities’ income or losses. The Company owned a 15% equity interest in Alderwood Partners LLP (“Alderwood”) from September 20, 2020 through July 31, 2022, when the Company retired as a member of Alderwood. The Company analyzed its investment in Alderwood under the voting interest model and determined that it did not have a controlling financial interest. The Company accounted for its Alderwood investment using the equity method of accounting. Refer to Note 13, Equity Method Investment, for additional information on Alderwood. The Company applies the equity method of accounting to investments where it does not hold a controlling equity interest, but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial matters. In the event that management identifies an other than temporary decline in the estimated fair value of an equity method investment to an amount below its carrying value, the investment is written down to its estimated fair value. Use of Estimates and Assumptions The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Actual results may ultimately differ from those estimates and the differences may be material. Revenue Recognition   The Company accounts for revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The Company’s revenue includes fees earned from providing investment management services, fund administration services, fund compliance, fund transfer agent services and fund distribution services. Revenue is recognized for each distinct performance obligation identified in customer contracts when the performance obligation has been satisfied by transferring services to a customer either over time or at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the service. Revenue is recognized in the amount of variable or fixed consideration allocated to the satisfied performance obligation that Victory expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring services to a customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only when it is probable that a significant reversal of such revenue will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. For further information on the Company’s various revenue streams, refer to Note 3, Revenue. Distribution and Other Asset‑Based Expenses Distribution and other asset‑based expenses include (i) broker dealer distribution fees, (ii) platform distribution fees, (iii) sub‑administration, third party sub-transfer agent and sub‑advisory expenses. These expenses are accrued on a monthly basis and are generally calculated as a percentage of AUM and vary as levels of AUM change from inflows, outflows and market movement and with the number of days in the month. Also included in distribution and other asset‑based expenses are middle office expenses. Middle office expenses are accrued on a monthly basis and vary with changes in mutual fund, institutional and wrap separate account AUM levels, the number of accounts and volume of account transaction activity. Restructuring and Integration Costs In connection with business combinations, asset purchases and changes in business strategy, the Company incurs costs integrating investment platforms, products and personnel into existing systems, processes and service provider arrangements and restructuring the business to capture operating expense synergies. These costs include severance‑related expenses related to one‑time benefit arrangements and contract termination costs. A liability for restructuring costs is recognized only after management has developed a formal plan to which it has committed. The costs included in the restructuring liability are those costs that are either incremental or incurred as a direct result of the plan, or are the result of a continuing contractual obligation with no continuing economic benefit to the Company, or a penalty incurred to cancel the contractual obligation. Severance expense is recorded when management has committed to a plan for a reduction in workforce, the plan has been communicated to employees and it is unlikely that there will be significant changes to the plan. Contract termination liabilities are recorded for contract termination costs when the Company terminates a contract or stops using the product or service covered by the contract. Contract termination liabilities are recognized and measured at fair value. Contract termination costs are recorded in restructuring and integration costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash at banks, money market accounts and funds and short‑term liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. For the Company and certain subsidiaries, cash deposits at a financial institution may exceed Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insurance limits. Investments Investments in Proprietary Funds Investments in proprietary funds include investments in affiliated mutual funds and are recorded in investments in proprietary funds, at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in fair value are recognized in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification method. Dividend income is accrued on the declaration date and is included in other income in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Transactions are recorded on a trade‑date basis. The Company periodically reviews each individual security that is in an unrealized loss position to determine if the impairment is other‑than‑temporary. Factors that are considered in determining whether other‑than‑temporary declines in value have occurred include the severity and duration of the unrealized loss and the Company’s ability and intent to hold the security for a length of time sufficient to allow for recovery of such unrealized losses. Impairment charges are recorded in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. No impairments were recognized as a result of such review in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Deferred Compensation Plan Investments Deferred compensation plan investments include investments in affiliated and third party mutual funds held in a rabbi trust under a deferred compensation plan. Deferred compensation plan investments are recorded at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in value in deferred compensation plan investments are recognized by the Company in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company's investments in proprietary funds and deferred compensation plan investments are valued through the use of quoted market prices available in an active market, which is the net asset value of the funds. Derivative Financial Instruments On March 27, 2020, the Company entered into an interest rate swap transaction (the “Swap”) to manage interest rate risk associated with a portion of its floating-rate long-term debt. The Company does not purchase or hold any derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. The designation of a derivative instrument as a hedge and its ability to meet the hedge accounting criteria determine how the Company reflects the change in fair value of the derivative instrument. A derivative qualifies for hedge accounting treatment if, at inception, it meets defined correlation and effectiveness criteria. These criteria require that the anticipated cash flows and/or changes in fair value of the hedging instrument substantially offset those of the position being hedged. The Swap is assessed for effectiveness and continued qualification for hedge accounting on a quarterly basis. Since inception, the Swap was deemed to be highly effective. The Swap is designated as a cash flow hedge. Accordingly, the Swap is measured at fair value with mark-to-market gains or losses deferred and included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI(L)”), net of tax, to the extent the hedge is determined to be effective. Gains or losses from the Swap are reclassified to interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Refer to Note 12, Derivatives, for further information. Property and Equipment Property and equipment is recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight‑line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, generally three to ten years. Improvements to leased property are amortized on a straight‑line basis over the lesser of the useful life of the improvements or the term of the applicable lease. When assets are sold or retired, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective accounts and any resulting gain or loss is included in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Gains and losses resulting from the sale or disposal of assets as part of a restructuring plan are included in restructuring and integration costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The cost of repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Equipment and leasehold improvements are tested for impairment whenever changes in facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Leases The Company’s leases consist primarily of real estate leases for office space. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at contract inception. A lease liability and a corresponding right-of-use (""ROU"") asset are recognized on the commencement date for leases with terms longer than one year. Lease liabilities represent an obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease while ROU assets represent a right to use an underlying asset during the lease term. The lease liability is measured at the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term generally using the Company's incremental borrowing rate, which is determined through market sources. Lease components and non-lease components such as fixed maintenance and other costs are combined into one lease component and capitalized in lease liabilities. Variable lease payments, such as utilities and common area maintenance charges, are excluded from lease liabilities and expensed as incurred. The variable lease payments are determined based on terms in the lease contracts and primarily relate to usage of the ROU asset and services received from the lessor. A ROU asset is measured initially as the value of the lease liability plus initial direct costs and prepaid lease payments and less lease incentives received. The lease term includes periods covered by options to extend the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is recorded in general and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Capitalized Service Contract Implementation Costs The Company follows the internal-use software guidance in ASC 350-40 to determine for hosting arrangements that are service contracts which implementation costs to capitalize as assets. Costs incurred in the software application development stage such as customization, integration with Company software, coding and configuration are capitalized. Costs incurred in the preliminary project and post-implementation stages are expensed as incurred. Capitalized service contract implementation costs are expensed over the fixed, noncancelable term of the contract plus any reasonably certain renewal periods. The estimated term of the hosting arrangement is reassessed periodically, and any change is accounted for as a change in accounting estimate, with the remaining deferred costs recognized over the rest of the revised period. Amortization begins when the related component of the arrangement is ready for its intended use, and costs are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis. Segment Reporting The Company operates in one business segment that provides investment management services and products to institutional, intermediary, retirement platforms and individual investors. Our determination that we had one operating segment is based on the fact that the Chief Operating Decision Maker reviews the Company's financial performance on an aggregate level. Goodwill Goodwill represents the excess cost of the acquisition over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination. For goodwill impairment testing purposes, the Company has determined that there is only one reporting unit. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired. Factors that could trigger an impairment review include underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results, significant changes in the Company's use of the acquired assets in a business combination or strategy for the Company's overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends and significant decreases in the Company’s market capitalization. The Company conducts the annual impairment assessment as of October 1st and uses a qualitative approach to test for potential impairment of goodwill. If, after considering various factors, management determines that it is more likely than not that goodwill is impaired, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount. A goodwill impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit’s carrying amount exceeds its fair value. The assumptions used to estimate fair value include management's estimates of future growth rates, operating cash flows, discount rates and terminal value. These assumptions and estimates can change in future periods based on market movement and factors impacting the expected business performance. Changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the determination of our fair value. Intangible Assets Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are initially recognized and measured at fair value. Intangible assets acquired by the Company outside of a business combination are initially recognized and measured based on the Company's cost to acquire the intangible assets. If a group of assets is acquired, the cost is allocated to individual assets based on their relative fair value. In valuing these assets, we make assumptions regarding useful lives and projected growth rates, and significant judgment is required. Definite‑lived intangible assets represent the value of acquired customer relationships in or with institutional separate accounts, collective funds, intermediary wrap separate account (wrap SMA), unified managed account/model (UMA) intermediaries and private funds. Definite‑lived intangible assets also include intellectual property, advisory contracts that do not have a sufficient history of annual renewal, definite-lived trade name assets, lease-related assets and non‑competition agreements. The Company amortizes definite‑lived identifiable intangible assets on a straight‑line basis over a period that is shorter than the asset's economic life as the pattern of economic benefit cannot be reliably determined.   Management periodically evaluates the remaining useful lives and carrying values of the intangible assets to determine whether events and circumstances indicate that a change in the useful life or impairment in value may have occurred. Indicators of impairment monitored by management include a decline in the level of managed assets, changes to contractual provisions underlying certain intangible assets and reductions in underlying operating cash flows. Should there be an indication of a change in the useful life or impairment in value of the definite‑lived intangible assets, we compare the carrying value of the asset to the projected undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the underlying asset over its remaining useful life to determine whether impairment has occurred. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows, the asset is written down to its fair value determined using discounted cash flows. The Company writes off the cost and accumulated amortization balances for all fully amortized intangible assets. Indefinite‑lived intangible assets include trade names and contracts for fund advisory, distribution and transfer agent services where the Company expects to, and has the ability to continue to manage these funds indefinitely, the contracts have annual renewal provisions, and there is a high likelihood of continued renewal based on historical experience. Trade names are considered indefinite‑lived intangible assets when they are expected to generate cash flows indefinitely. Indefinite‑lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment annually as of October 1st using a qualitative approach which requires that positive and negative evidence collected as a result of considering various factors be weighed in order to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite‑lived intangible asset is impaired. In addition, periodically management reconsiders whether events or circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life. Indicators monitored by management that may indicate an indefinite useful life is no longer supported include a significant decline in the level of managed assets, changes to legal, regulatory or contractual provisions of the renewable investment advisory contracts and reductions in underlying operating cash flows. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are combined into a single unit of accounting for purposes of testing impairment if they operate as a single asset and represent as a group the highest and best use of the assets. If the qualitative approach indicates that it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired, the Company estimates the fair value of the indefinite‑lived intangible asset and compares it to the book value of the asset to determine whether an impairment charge is necessary. Impairment is indicated when the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value. Investment Management Fees Receivable and Fund Administration and Distribution Fees Receivable Investment management fees receivable include investment management fees due from the Victory Funds, USAA Funds, VictoryShares and other pooled funds sponsored by Victory and investment management fees due from non-affiliated parties. Fund administration and distribution fees receivable include administration, compliance and distribution fees due from the Victory Funds, USAA Funds and VictoryShares and transfer agent fees due from the USAA Funds and sub-transfer agent fees due from the Victory Funds. Provision for credit losses on these receivables is made in amounts required to maintain an adequate allowance to cover anticipated losses. All investment management fees receivable and fund administration and distribution fees receivable were determined to be collectible as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, and accordingly, no reserve for credit losses and no provision for credit losses were recognized as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Other Receivables Other receivables primarily include income and other taxes receivable and were determined to be collectible as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Advertising and Marketing Costs In December 2022, the Company entered into a long-term partnership with Spurs Sports & Entertainment and executed naming rights and partnership agreements for the team’s new performance center. The agreements, which end in 2033, grant the Company exclusive naming rights, sponsorship, signage, advertising and other promotional rights and benefits for the new performance center. Payments made under the agreements are deferred and expensed on a straight-line basis over the term of the arrangement. The related advertising and marketing expense is recorded in general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The balance of amounts paid less amortized expense are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in other assets when cumulative payments exceed amortized expense and in other liabilities when amortized expense exceeds cumulative payments. Share‑Based Compensation Arrangements Compensation expense related to share‑based payments is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The fair value of each option granted is estimated using the Black‑Scholes option valuation model. The fair value of restricted share awards with service based vesting conditions and performance based vesting conditions is based on the market price of our stock on the date of grant. The fair value of restricted share awards subject to market conditions is estimated based on a probability-weighted expected value analysis. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight‑line basis over the total vesting period of the award for the service portion of restricted share awards and stock option awards. Compensation expense is recognized on an accelerated basis over the derived service period for awards that vest based on market conditions and on an accelerated basis over the requisite service period for awards with performance conditions if it is probable that the performance conditions will be satisfied. Compensation expense is adjusted for actual forfeitures in the period the forfeiture occurs. The corresponding credit for restricted share and stock option compensation expense is recorded to additional paid in capital. When changes are made to the terms of an equity award that result in a change in the fair value of the equity award immediately before and after the change, the Company applies modification accounting, treating the change as an exchange of the original award for a new award. The calculation of the incremental value associated with the modified award is based on the excess of the fair value of the modified award over the fair value of the original award measured immediately before its terms are modified. Earnings Per Share The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares of the Company’s Common Stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is similar to basic earnings per share, but adjusts for the dilutive effect of the potential issuance of incremental shares of the Company’s Common Stock. The Company had vested and unvested stock options and unvested restricted stock grants outstanding during the periods presented and applies the treasury stock method to these securities in its calculation of diluted earnings per share. The treasury stock method assumes that the proceeds of exercise are used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. The Company does not have any participating securities that would require the use of the two‑class method of computing earnings per share. Deferred Financing Fees The costs of obtaining term loan financing are capitalized in long‑term debt in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized to interest expense and other financing costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the term of the respective financing using the effective interest method. The costs of obtaining revolving line of credit financing are capitalized in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized to interest expense and other financing costs in the Consolidated Statements of Operations on a straight‑line basis over the term of the facility. The Company expenses the portion of unamortized debt financing costs associated with paydowns of principal in excess of required loan amortization payments. Management considers this debt to be partially settled. Deferred financing costs expensed due to partial settlements of debt are recorded in loss on debt extinguishment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Debt Modification Gains and losses on debt modifications that are considered extinguishments are recognized in current earnings. Debt modifications that are not considered extinguishments are accounted for prospectively through yield adjustments, based on the revised terms. Legal fees and other costs incurred with third parties that are directly related to debt modifications are expensed as incurred and generally are included in general and administrative expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company expensed $0.4 million and $0.9 million in costs related to debt modifications in 2021 and 2020, respectively ($0 in 2022). The analysis as to whether a modification of debt is an extinguishment or modification is performed on a creditor‑by‑creditor basis. Refer to Note 11, Debt, for further information on debt refinancings and modifications. Treasury Stock   Acquisitions of treasury stock are recorded at cost. Treasury stock held is reported as a deduction from stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At the date of subsequent reissue, the treasury stock account is reduced by the cost of such stock on a specific‑identification basis. Additional paid‑in capital from treasury stock transactions is increased as the Company reissues treasury stock for more than the cost of the shares. If the Company issues treasury stock for less than its cost, additional paid‑in capital from treasury stock transactions is reduced to no less than zero. Once this account is at zero, any further required reductions are recorded to retained earnings in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Foreign Currency Transactions The financial statements of the Company’s subsidiaries which operate outside of the United States (U.S.) are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Adjustments to translate those statements into U.S. dollars are recorded in other comprehensive income (loss), which were immaterial in amount at December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are recorded using the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. Exchange differences arising on the settlement of financial assets and liabilities are recorded in other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Foreign exchange gains and losses for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were immaterial. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for using the assets and liability method as required by ASC 740, Income Taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax liabilities are generally attributable to indefinite‑lived intangible assets, share-based compensation expense, goodwill, depreciation, debt issuance costs and mark-to-market gains on the Swap. Deferred tax assets are generally attributable to definite‑lived intangible assets, deferred compensation and acquisition-related costs. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company assesses whether a valuation allowance should be established against its deferred income tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence, both positive and negative, using a more-likely-than-not standard. The assessment considers, among other matters, recent operating results, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carry back and carry forward periods and the Company's experience with tax attributes expiring unused. Changes in circumstances could cause the Company to revalue its deferred tax balances with the resulting change impacting the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period of the change. The Company records income tax liabilities pursuant to ASC 740, Income Taxes, which prescribes the recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. It also provides guidance on de‑recognition, classification of interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosure and transition. For tax positions meeting a more‑likely‑than‑not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount of benefit greater than 50% likely of being sustained. The more‑likely‑than‑not threshold must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of the benefit. The Company's accounting policy with respect to interest and penalties related to tax uncertainties is to classify these amounts as income taxes. Loss Contingencies The Company continuously reviews investor, client, employee or vendor complaints and pending or threatened litigation. The Company evaluates the likelihood that a loss contingency exists under the criteria of applicable accounting standards through consultation with legal counsel and records a loss contingency, inclusive of legal costs, if the contingency is probable and reasonably estimable at the date of the financial statements. Business Combinations The Company accounts for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting and allocates the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. The fair values are determined in accordance with the guidance in ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, based on valuations performed by the Company and independent valuation specialists.   Asset Acquisitions When a group of assets is acquired that does constitute a business, the Company accounts for the transaction as an asset acquisition. The cost of the acquisition, which includes transaction costs directly related to the transaction and consideration paid, is allocated on a relative fair value basis to the net assets acquired. Contingent and Deferred Payment Arrangements The Company periodically enters into contingent and/or deferred payment arrangements in connection with its business combinations. Liabilities under contingent and deferred payment arrangements are recorded in consideration payable for acquisition of business in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In contingent payment arrangements, the Company agrees to pay additional consideration to the sellers based on future performance, such as future net revenue levels. The Company estimates the fair value of these potential future obligations at the time a business combination is consummated and records a liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at estimated fair value. In deferred payment arrangements, the Company records a liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the time a business combination is consummated for the present value, which is the estimated fair value, of the future fixed dollar contractual payments. Contingent payment obligations are remeasured at fair value each reporting date taking into consideration changes in expected payments, and the change in fair value is recorded in the current period as a gain or loss. Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of contingent payment obligations are reflected in change in value of consideration payable for acquisition of business in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company accretes obligations under deferred payment arrangements to their expected payment amounts over the period covered by the arrangement. Compensatory Payment Arrangements In connection with business combinations, the Company evaluates whether any portion of the transaction consideration is in exchange for elements other than the acquired business and should be accounted for as a separate transaction apart from the business combination. If based on the substance of the contingent payment arrangement, the Company determines that the payments are compensation for post-acquisition employee services, the Company considers this a compensatory payment arrangement and no liability is recorded for the payments on the acquisition date. The related expense, which is the total amount of compensation management estimates will be paid, is accrued on a straight-line basis over the estimated service period, which is the time period when management determines that it is probable that the performance conditions will be achieved. At each reporting date, cumulative expense recognized under the compensatory payment arrangement will be at least equal to the cumulative dollar amount actually paid out and currently payable under the terms of the related purchase agreement. If there is a significant change in the estimated service period and/or estimated total compensation amount, management generally adjusts the amount of expense recorded on a prospective basis. Expense recognized under compensatory payment arrangements is recorded in personnel compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and the related liability is included in accrued compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

38,,". Loss on Debt Extinguishment 2022 compared to 2021 – Loss on debt extinguishment decreased by $1.9 million to $2.6 million in 2022 compared to $4.6 million in the prior year. The decrease is due to expenses incurred in 2021 related to entering into the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement. 2021 compared to 2020 – Loss on debt extinguishment increased by $1.7 million, or 60.1%, to $4.6 million in 2021 compared to $2.9 million in the prior year. The increase is largely due to repayments of term loan principal and entering into the Second Amendment to the Credit Agreement in February 2021. Also contributing, but to a lesser extent, were unamortized debt issuance and unamortized debt discount expenses which were partially offset by gains recognized on repurchases and retirement of outstanding debt below par in the open market in 2020. Income Tax Expense 2022 compared to 2021 – Our effective tax rate increased 0.7% from 20.6% in 2021 to 21.3% in 2022. The change in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increased non-deductible expenses. Refer to Note 10, Income Taxes, to the audited financial statements for further details on income taxes. 2021 compared to 2020 – Our effective tax rate decreased 3.1% from 23.7% in 2020 to 20.6% in 2021. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to higher excess tax benefits on share-based compensation. Refer to Note 10, Income Taxes, to the audited financial statements for further details on income taxes. "
39,,". RISK FACTORS. Risk Factors Summary The following is a summary of risks and uncertainties that affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are providing the following summary of risk factors to enhance readability of our risk factor disclosure. Material risks that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following: Market and Investment Performance Risks We earn substantially all of our revenues based on AUM, and any reduction in AUM would reduce our revenues and profitability. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine has, and will likely continue to, negatively impact the global economy. If our strategies perform poorly, clients could redeem their assets and we could suffer a decline in our AUM, which would reduce our earnings. The historical returns of our strategies may not be indicative of their future results or of the strategies we may develop in the future. We may support our money market funds to maintain their stable net asset values, or other products we manage, which could affect our revenues or operating results. The performance of our strategies or the growth of our AUM may be constrained by unavailability of appropriate investment opportunities. Business Risks The COVID-19 and other pandemics have, and will likely continue to have, a negative impact on the global economy and interrupt normal business activity. The loss of key investment professionals or members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business. We derive substantially all of our revenues from contracts and relationships that may be terminated upon short or no notice. Investors in certain funds that we advise can redeem their assets from those funds at any time without prior notice. Investment recommendations provided to our direct investor channel may not be suitable or fulfill regulatory requirements; representatives may not disclose or address conflicts of interest, conduct inadequate due diligence, provide inadequate disclosure; transactions may be subject to human error or fraud. The significant growth we have experienced over the past few years may be difficult to sustain and our growth strategy is dependent in part upon our ability to make and successfully integrate new strategic acquisitions. Our expenses are subject to fluctuations that could materially impact our results of operations. A significant proportion of our existing AUM is managed in long‑only investments. Our efforts to establish and develop new teams and strategies may be unsuccessful and could negatively impact our results of operations and could negatively impact our reputation and culture.   An assignment could result in termination of our investment advisory agreements to manage SEC‑registered funds and could trigger consent requirements in our other investment advisory agreements. Our failure to comply with investment guidelines set by our clients, including the boards of registered funds, and limitations imposed by applicable law, could result in damage awards against us and a loss of AUM, either of which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. We provide a broad range of services to the Victory Funds, USAA Funds, VictoryShares and sub‑advised mutual funds which may expose us to liability. Potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets could result in not realizing the value of these assets. If we were deemed an investment company required to register under the the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”), we would become subject to burdensome regulatory requirements and our business activities could be restricted. Merger and Acquisition Risks We may not realize the benefits we expect from mergers and acquisitions because of integration difficulties and other challenges. Certain liabilities resulting from acquisitions are estimated and could lead to a material impact on earnings. "
40,,". Revenue The Company’s revenue includes fees earned from providing; • investment management services, • fund administration services, • fund transfer agent services, and • fund distribution services. Revenue is recognized for each distinct performance obligation identified in customer contracts when the performance obligation has been satisfied by transferring services to a customer either over time or at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the service. Revenue is recognized in the amount of variable or fixed consideration allocated to the satisfied performance obligation that Victory expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring services to a customer. Variable consideration is included in the transaction price only when it is probable that a significant reversal of such revenue will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. Investment management, fund administration and fund distribution fees are generally considered variable consideration as they are typically calculated as a percentage of AUM. Fund transfer agent fees are also considered variable consideration as they are calculated as a percentage of AUM or based on the number of accounts in the fund. In such cases, the amount of fees earned is subject to factors outside of the Company’s control including customer or underlying investor contributions and redemptions and financial market volatility. These fees are considered constrained and are excluded from the transaction price until the asset values or number of accounts on which the customer is billed are calculated and the value of consideration is measurable. The Company has contractual arrangements with third parties to provide certain advisory, administration, transfer agent and distribution services. Management considers whether we are acting as the principal service provider or as an agent to determine whether revenue should be recorded based on the gross amount payable by the customer or net of payments to third-party service providers, respectively. Victory is considered a principal service provider if we control the service that is transferred to the customer. We are considered an agent when we arrange for the service to be provided by another party and do not control the service. Investment Management Fees Investment management fees are received in exchange for investment management services that represent a series of distinct incremental days of investment management service. Control of investment management services is transferred to the customers over time as these customers receive and consume the benefits provided by these services. Investment management fees are calculated as a contractual percentage of AUM and are generally paid in arrears on a monthly or quarterly basis. AUM represents the financial assets the Company manages for clients on either a discretionary or non-discretionary basis. In general, AUM reflects the valuation methodology that corresponds to the basis used for determining revenue such as net asset value for the Victory Funds, USAA Funds and certain other pooled funds and account market value for separate accounts. For the NEC Funds, AUM represents limited partner capital commitments during the commitment period of the fund. Following the earlier of the termination of the commitment period and the beginning of any commitment period for a successor fund, AUM generally represents, depending on the fund, the lesser of a) the net asset value of the fund and b) the aggregated adjusted cost basis of each unrealized portfolio investment or the limited partner capital commitments reduced by the amount of capital contributions used to make portfolio investments that have been disposed. Investment management fees are recognized as revenue using a time-based output method to measure progress. Revenue is recorded at month end or quarter end when the value of consideration is measured. The amount of investment management fee revenue varies from one reporting period to another as levels of AUM change (from inflows, outflows and market movements) and as the number of days in the reporting period change. The Company may waive certain fees for investment management services provided to the Victory Funds, USAA Funds, VictoryShares and other pooled investment vehicles and may subsidize certain share classes of the Victory Funds, USAA Funds, VictoryShares and other pooled investment vehicles to ensure that specified operating expenses attributable to such share classes do not exceed a specified percentage. These waivers and reimbursements reduce the transaction price allocated to investment management services and are recognized as a reduction to investment management fees revenue. The amounts due to the Victory Funds, USAA Funds, VictoryShares and other pooled investment vehicles for waivers and expense reimbursements represent consideration payable to customers, which is recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and no distinct services are received in exchange for these payments. Performance-based investment management fees, which include fees under performance fee and fulcrum fee arrangements, are included in the transaction price for providing investment management services. Performance-based investment management fees are calculated as a percentage of investment performance on a client’s account versus a specified benchmark or hurdle based on the terms of the contract with the customer. Performance-based investment management fees are variable consideration and are recognized as revenue when and to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue for the contractual performance period will not occur. Performance-based investment management fees recognized as revenue in the current period may pertain to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods. Fulcrum fee arrangements include a performance fee adjustment that increases or decreases the total investment management fee depending on whether the assets being managed experienced better or worse investment performance than the index specified in the customer’s contract. The performance fee adjustment arrangement with certain equity and fixed income USAA Funds took effect on July 1, 2020 and is calculated monthly based on the investment performance of those funds relative to their specified benchmark indexes over the discrete performance period ending with that month. Fund Administration Fees The Company recognizes fund administration fees as revenue using a time-based output method to measure progress. Fund administration fees are determined based on the contractual rate applied to average daily net assets of the Victory Funds, USAA Funds and VictoryShares for which administration services are provided. Revenue is recorded on a monthly basis when the value of consideration is measured using actual average daily net assets and constraints are removed. The Company’s fund administration fee revenue is recorded in fund administration and distribution fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company has contractual arrangements with a third party to provide certain sub-administration services. We are the primary obligor under the contracts with the Victory Funds, USAA Funds and VictoryShares and have the ability to select the service provider and establish pricing. As a result, fund administration fees and sub-administration expenses are recorded on a gross basis. Fund Transfer Agent Fees The Company recognizes fund transfer agent fees using a time-based output method to measure progress. Fund transfer agent fees are determined based on the contractual rate applied to either the average daily net assets of the USAA Funds for which transfer agent services are provided or number of accounts in the USAA Funds. Revenue is recorded on a monthly basis when the value of consideration is measured using actual average daily net assets or actual number of accounts and constraints are removed. The Company’s fund transfer agent fee revenue is recorded in fund administration and distribution fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company also receives fees for sub-transfer agency services under contracts with the Victory Funds for member class shares. Sub-transfer agency fees are recognized and recorded in a manner similar to fund transfer agent fees and are recorded in fund administration and distribution fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company has contractual arrangements with a third party to provide certain sub-transfer agent services. As the Company is the primary obligor under the transfer agency contracts with the USAA Funds and has the ability to select the service provider and establish pricing, fund transfer agent fees and sub-transfer agent expenses are recorded on a gross basis. Fund Distribution Fees The Company receives compensation for sales and sales-related services promised under distribution contracts with the Victory Funds and USAA Funds. Revenue is measured in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for providing distribution services. Distribution fees are generally calculated as a percentage of average net assets in the Victory Funds and USAA Funds. The Company’s performance obligation is satisfied at the point in time when control of the services is transferred to customers, which is upon investor subscription or redemption. Based on the nature of the calculation, the revenue for these services is accounted for as variable consideration. The Company may recognize distribution fee revenue in the current period that pertains to performance obligations satisfied in prior periods as variable consideration is recognized only when uncertainties are resolved. The Company’s distribution fee revenue is recorded in fund administration and distribution fees in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company has contractual arrangements with third parties to provide certain distribution services. The Company is the primary obligor under the contracts with the Victory Funds and USAA Funds and has the ability to select the service provider and establish pricing. Substantially all of the Company’s revenue is recorded gross of payments made to third parties. Costs Incurred to Obtain or Fulfill Customer Contracts The Company is required to capitalize certain costs directly related to the acquisition or fulfillment of a contact with a customer. Victory has not identified any sales-based compensation or similar costs that meet the definition of an incremental cost to acquire a contract and as such we have no intangible assets related to contract acquisitions. Direct costs incurred to fulfill services under the Company’s distribution contracts include sales commissions paid to third party dealers for the sale of Class C Shares. The Company may pay upfront sales commissions to dealers and institutions that sell Class C shares of the participating Victory Funds at the time of such sale. Upfront sales commission payments with respect to Class C shares equal 1.00% of the purchase price of the Class C shares sold by the dealer or institution. When the Company makes an upfront payment to a dealer or institution for the sale of Class C shares, the Company capitalizes the cost of such payment, which is recorded in prepaid expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortizes the cost over a 12-month period, the estimated period of benefit. Valuation of AUM and fund investments The fair value of assets under management of the Victory Funds, USAA Funds and VictoryShares is primarily determined using quoted market prices or independent third-party pricing services or broker price quotes. In certain circumstances, a quotation or price evaluation is not readily available from a pricing service. In these cases, pricing is determined by management based on a prescribed valuation process that has been approved by the directors/trustees of the sponsored products. The same prescribed valuation process is used to price securities in separate accounts and the Company’s other non-alternative investment vehicles for which a quotation or price evaluation is not readily available from a pricing service. The fair value of Level III assets held by alternative investment vehicles is determined under the respective valuation policy for each fund. The valuation policies address the fact that substantially all the investments of a fund may not have readily available market information and therefore the fair value for these assets is typically determined using unobservable inputs and models that may include subjective assumptions. AUM reported by the Company for alternative investment vehicles may not necessarily equal the funds’ net asset values or the total fair value of the funds’ portfolio investments as AUM represents the basis for calculating management fees. For the periods presented, less than one percent of the Company’s total AUM were Level III assets priced without using a quoted market price, broker price quote or pricing service quotation.   NOTE 4. ACQUISITION USAA AMCO Acquisition On July 1, 2019, the Company completed the USAA AMCO Acquisition. The USAA AMCO Acquisition expanded and diversified the Company’s investment platform, particularly in the fixed income and solutions asset classes, and increased the Company’s size and scale. Additional products added to the investments platform include target date and target risk strategies, managed volatility mutual funds, active fixed income ETFs, sub-advised and multi-manager equity funds. The acquisition also added to the Company’s lineup of asset allocation portfolios and smart beta equity ETFs and provided the Company the rights to offer products and services using the USAA brand and the opportunity to offer its products to USAA members through a direct investor channel. Contingent Consideration Under the terms of the purchase agreement for the USAA AMCO Acquisition, a maximum of $150.0 million ($37.5 million per year) in contingent payments is payable to sellers based on the annual revenue of USAA Adviser attributable to all “non-managed money”-related AUM in each of the first four annual earn out periods following the closing. To receive any contingent payment in respect of “non-managed money”-related assets for a given year, annual revenue from “non-managed money”-related assets must be at least 80% of the revenue run-rate (as calculated under the purchase agreement) of the USAA Adviser’s “non-managed money”-related assets under management as of the acquisition closing date, and to achieve the maximum contingent payment for a given year, such annual revenue must total at least 100% of that acquisition date revenue run-rate. The estimated fair value for contingent consideration payable to sellers is estimated using the real options method. Revenue related to “non-managed money” assets is simulated in a risk-neutral framework to calculate expected probability-weighted earn out payments, which are then discounted from the expected payment dates at the relevant cost of debt. Significant assumptions and inputs include the “non-managed money” revenue projected annual growth rate, the market price of risk, which adjusts the projected revenue growth rate to a risk-neutral expected growth rate, revenue volatility and discount rate. The market price of risk and revenue volatility are based on data for comparable companies. As the contingent consideration represents a subordinate, unsecured claim of the Company, the Company assesses a discount rate which incorporates adjustments for credit risk and the subordination of the contingent consideration The fair value of contingent consideration payable to sellers was estimated at $27.7 million and $68.8 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $98.8 million as of the acquisition date. The Company recorded a decrease in the liability of $3.6 million in 2022 and an increase in the liability of $13.8 million and $11.3 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, in change in value of consideration payable for acquisition of business in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2022, the Company has paid a total of $112.5 million (the $37.5 million maximum payment for each of the first three earn out periods) in contingent consideration to sellers. Significant inputs to the valuation of contingent consideration payable to sellers as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the acquisition date are as follows and are approximate values:                               USAA Acquired Companies       Net income attributable to the USAA Acquired Companies for the first six months of 2020 is impractical to determine as the Company does not prepare discrete financial information at that level. THB Acquisition On March 1, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of certain assets of THB, including without limitation, (i) certain investment advisory and business contracts, (ii) certain books and records, (iii) the investment performance track record, and (iv) all business intellectual property and proprietary software. In addition, the  Company hired the THB investment team and acquired THB AUM of $547 million. THB manages responsible investment portfolios in the micro-cap, small-cap and mid-cap asset classes, including U.S., global and international strategies. Because substantially all of the fair value of the acquired assets was concentrated in a single identifiable asset, the transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition. Estimated acquisition costs of $0.6 million were allocated to a definite-lived customer relationship intangible asset. NEC Acquisition On November 1, 2021, VCM completed the acquisition of 100% of the equity interests in NEC. Founded in 2004 and based in Hanover, New Hampshire, NEC is an alternative asset management firm focused on debt and equity investments in clean energy infrastructure projects and companies through private closed-end funds (the “NEC Funds”). The NEC Acquisition purchase price was $63.1 million, which included $62.8 million in cash paid at closing, net of cash acquired, and $0.3 million of net working capital adjustments paid to sellers in March 2022. Consideration paid at closing was funded with balance sheet cash and proceeds from borrowings under the Company’s revolving line of credit. All borrowings under the revolving line of credit were repaid prior to December 31, 2021. Under the terms of the purchase agreement, the Company will pay up to an additional $35.0 million in cash based on net revenue growth over a six year period following the closing date. The purchase agreement specifies net revenue and payment targets for the 36-month, 48-month and 60-month periods beginning on November 30, 2021 (the “Start Date”) for the contingent payments. It also provides for advance payments and catch-up payments to be made based on actual NEC net management fee revenue, as defined in the purchase agreement, as measured at the end of each 12 month anniversary of the Start Date over a six year period. The maximum amount of contingent payments is due, less any contingent payments previously paid, upon the occurrence of certain specified events within a five year period following the Start Date. The Company determined that substantially all of the contingent payments payable per the NEC purchase agreement represent compensation for post-closing services. Accordingly, these contingent payments were excluded from the purchase price for the NEC Acquisition and a liability for these contingent payments was not recorded on the acquisition date. The Company recognizes compensation expense over the estimated service period on a straight-line basis in an amount equal to the total contingent payments currently forecasted to be paid. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had recorded $8.1 million and $1.1 million, respectively, in NEC contingent payment compensation expense, which is included in personnel compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. A liability for the corresponding amount is recorded in accrued compensation and benefits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The NEC Acquisition purchase price of $62.8 million was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values on the acquisition date. The Company used an independent valuation specialist to assist with the determination of fair value for certain of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities disclosed below. The carried interests in the existing NEC Funds were not acquired in the transaction. No adjustments were made to the purchase price allocation during the one year measurement period following the closing date. The excess purchase price over the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed of $41.0 million was recorded to goodwill in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill arising from the acquisition primarily results from future earnings and cash flows from new funds expected to be launched on the NEC alternative investment platform. WestEnd Acquisition On and effective December 31, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of WestEnd Advisors, LLC (“WestEnd Acquisition”). Founded in 2004, and headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, WestEnd is an ETF strategist advisor that provides financial advisors with a turnkey, core model allocation strategy for either a holistic solution or complementary source of alpha. The firm offers four primary ETF strategies and one large cap core strategy in Separately Managed Account (SMA) structures. The aggregate purchase price for the WestEnd Acquisition was $716.1 million, net of cash acquired, which includes (i) $475.8 million in cash paid at closing (the “WestEnd Closing”) net of cash acquired, (ii) the acquisition date value of contingent payments due to sellers of $239.7 million and iii) $0.6 million paid in cash to sellers in April 2022 for net working capital adjustments. The contingent earn-out payments are based on net revenue of the WestEnd business during each of the first four years following the WestEnd Closing, subject to certain “catch-up” provisions over a five and one half year period following the WestEnd Closing. A maximum of $320.0 million ($80.0 million per year) in earn-out payments may be paid. In connection with the closing of the WestEnd Acquisition, the Company entered into the Third Amendment to the 2019 Credit Agreement and obtained incremental term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $505.0 million to fund the acquisition and pay fees and expenses related to the transaction. Please refer to Note 11, Debt, for more information on the 2021 Incremental Term Loans. A total of $2.9 million of the cash paid at closing was placed in escrow. In April 2022, the $0.5 million of escrow funds reserved for purchase price adjustments was released to sellers. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining $2.4 million of escrow funds remained available to compensate the Company for eligible claims under the purchase agreement’s indemnification provisions. The purchase price of $716.1 million was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of the WestEnd Acquisition. The Company used an independent valuation specialist to assist with the determination of fair value for certain of the acquired assets and assumed liabilities disclosed below. No adjustments were made to the purchase price allocation during the one year measurement period following the closing date. The excess purchase price over the estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed of $536.0 million was recorded to goodwill in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, all of which is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The goodwill arising from the acquisition primarily results from revenue synergies expected from combining WestEnd and Victory distribution platforms and sales efforts. A maximum of $320.0 million ($80.0 million per year) is payable to sellers in contingent payments. The estimated fair value of contingent consideration payable to sellers was $207.7 million at December 31, 2022 and $239.7 million as of the acquisition date. Significant inputs to the valuation of contingent consideration payable to sellers as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows and are approximate values:  As the WestEnd Acquisition was effective at market close on December 31, 2021, the Company’s operating results for 2021 do not include WestEnd. The following Unaudited Pro Forma Condensed Combined Statements of Operations are provided for illustrative purposes only and assume that the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2020. This unaudited information should not be relied upon as indicative of historical results that would have been obtained if the acquisition had occurred on that date, nor of the results that may be obtained in the future. The historical consolidated financial information of the Company and WestEnd have been adjusted to give effect to unaudited pro forma events that are directly attributable to the WestEnd Acquisition. These amounts have been calculated after adjusting the results of WestEnd and the Company to reflect additional interest expense, intangible asset amortization, acquisition-related costs, transaction-related compensation costs and income taxes that would have been expensed assuming the WestEnd Acquisition was consummated on January 1, 2020. Acquisition-related costs Costs related to acquisitions of businesses and assets are summarized below and include legal and filing fees, advisory services, mutual fund proxy voting costs and other one‑time expenses related to the transactions. Included in USAA AMCO acquisition-related costs in 2021 is a liability for one-time payments for assets not acquired in the transaction.    NOTE 5. FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The Company determines the fair value of certain financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities. Fair value is determined based on the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Fair value determinations utilize a valuation hierarchy based upon the transparency of inputs used in the valuation of an asset or liability. Classification within the fair value hierarchy contains three levels: • Level 1—Valuation inputs are unadjusted quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities in active markets. • Level 2—Valuation inputs are quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, quoted market prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and other observable inputs directly or indirectly related to the asset or liability being measured. • Level 3—Valuation inputs are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement. These inputs reflect management's own assumptions about the assumptions a market participant would use in pricing the asset or liability. "

We offer both opened-end liquid alternative investments as well as closed-end private funds. Given our multi-faceted distribution channels, combined with our ability to develop investment vehicles to deliver these strategies, we are ideally situated to play a meaningful role in democratizing access to alternative investments for retail investors. With attractive fee rates, margins, longer capital commitments compared with our liquid products, and less likelihood of being disintermediated by non-active strategies, we remain interested in adding additional alternative investment capabilities. We are committed to maintaining the same guiding principles with alternative Investment Franchises that led to success with our traditional Investment Franchises. "
51, Strengths copy," Strengths copy. Competitive Strengths We believe we have significant competitive strengths that position us for sustained growth and shareholder value creation over the long term. We will seek to continue to augment our differentiated investment management platform by focusing on acquisition candidates that can make our investment platform better, that expand our distribution or investment capabilities, that optimize our operating platform and/or achieve our integration and synergy expectations. Portfolio of Investment Strategies with Potential for Outperformance – In assembling our portfolio of Franchises, we have selected investment managers offering strategies in asset classes where active managers have shown an established track record of outperformance relative to benchmarks through security and sector selection, and portfolio construction. We continue to build our platform to address the needs of clients who would like exposure to asset classes that have potential for alpha generation. We find that macro industry trends of asset flows moving from actively managed strategies to passive ones are less pronounced in certain of our asset classes. Diversified Platform Across Investment Strategies, Franchises and Client Type – We have strategically built an investment platform that is diversified by investment strategy, Franchise, and client type. Within each asset class, Franchises with overlapping investment mandates still contribute to our diversification by pursuing different investment philosophies and/or processes. For example, U.S. mid cap equities, which accounted for approximately 18% of total AUM as of December 31, 2022, consists of five Franchises, each following a different investment strategy. We believe the diversity in investment styles reduces the correlation between the return profiles of strategies within the same asset class, and consequently provides an additional layer of diversification of AUM and revenue stability. Our AUM also is well diversified at the Franchise level, with no Franchise accounting for more than 21% of total AUM. Furthermore, we believe our Franchises’ brand independence reduces the impact of each individual Franchise’s performance on clients’ perceptions of the other Franchises. The distribution of AUM by Franchise and the number of Franchises, as well as succession planning, mitigates the level of key man risk typically associated with investment management businesses. We believe our client base serves as another important diversifying element, as different client segments have shown to have distinct characteristics, including asset class and product preferences, sales and redemptions trends, and exposure to secular trends. We strive to maintain a balance between direct investor, retail clients, and institutional clients with 34%, 37% and 29% of our AUM as of December 31, 2022, in each of these channels, respectively. We also have the capability to deliver our strategies in investment vehicles designed to meet the needs and preferences of investors in each channel. These investment vehicles include actively and passively managed open-end mutual funds with channel‑specific share classes, rules-based and active ETFs, third-party ETF model strategies, SMAs, UMAs, VIPs, CITs, wrap account programs, UCITs, alternative investments, private closed end funds, and a 529 Education Savings Plan. If a strategy is currently not offered in the wrapper of choice for a client, we have the infrastructure and ability to create a new investment vehicle, which helps our Franchises further diversify their client bases.

Fourth Quarter 2022 Compared with Third Quarter 2022 Revenue decreased 2.8% to $201.5 million, in the fourth quarter, compared with $207.3 million in the third quarter, primarily due to lower average AUM, which decreased 2.7% from $158.9 billion to $154.6 billion. GAAP operating margin contracted 810 basis points in the fourth quarter to 39.5%, down from 47.6% in the third quarter. The decline was primarily driven by a non-cash $10.5 million difference in amounts recorded to change the fair value of consideration payable for acquisitions. Fourth-quarter GAAP net income decreased 28.2% to $52.3 million, down from $72.8 million in the prior quarter. Third quarter net income benefited from a lower than normal tax rate as a result of employees exercising stock options during the period.

The decrease was primarily due to lower average AUM, which decreased 4.7% to $154.6 billion, compared with $162.3 billion in the same quarter last year. Also contributing was a slight decrease in revenue realization due to a change in asset mix as a result of the impact of the WestEnd acquisition. Operating expenses decreased 12.5% to $121.9 million, compared with $139.3 million in last year’s fourth quarter primarily due to a decrease in acquisition-related costs related to the WestEnd and NEC acquisitions that closed in the fourth quarter of 2021 as well as a decrease in variable operating expenses from lower average AUM and earnings. GAAP operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 39.5% in the fourth quarter, from 39.2% in the same quarter of 2021.

The decrease was primarily due to lower average AUM and a decrease in revenue realization due to a change in asset mix, partially offset by a full-year of revenue from businesses acquired in 2021. Operating expenses decreased 11.8% to $455.7 million for year ended December 31, 2022, compared with $516.4 million in 2021 primarily due to a decrease in variable operating expenses from lower average AUM, a decrease in acquisition-related costs related to the WestEnd, NEC and THB acquisitions that closed in 2021, and a non-cash $54.4 million benefit in amounts recorded from the change in fair value of consideration payable for acquisitions.

GAAP net earnings per share increased to $3.81 per diluted share in 2022, up from $3.75 per diluted share in 2021 as a result of fewer weighted average shares outstanding in 2022. Adjusted net income with tax benefit decreased 7.2% to $331.2 million, or $4.58 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared with $357.1 million, or $4.82 per diluted share in 2021.

55,,". Integrated Distribution, Marketing and Operations The centralization of our distribution, marketing and operational functions is a key component in our model, allowing our Franchises to focus on their core competencies of security and sector selection, portfolio construction, and client service. In addition, we believe it provides our Franchises with the benefits of operating at scale, providing them with access to a larger number of clients as well as a more streamlined cost structure. As of December 31, 2022, we had 512 full-time employees with 184 in investment management, 238 in sales and marketing roles and 90 in management and support functions. Our centralized distribution and marketing functions lead the sales effort for our institutional, retail intermediary, and direct investor channels. Our sales teams are staffed with accomplished professionals that are given specific training on how to position each of our strategies. Our distribution teams have historically focused on developing strategic long-term relationships with institutional consultants, institutional asset owners, retail and retirement intermediaries, RIAs, Family Offices, the Direct Channel, and bank trust departments. Complementing these relationships, we use data extensively to enhance the effectiveness of our distribution teams. Investments in data packs from intermediaries, artificial intelligence initiatives, and predictive analytics — used to determine specific financial advisors’ propensities to buy or sell products —further enhance efficiencies. These relationships can enhance our platform’s overall reach and allow our Franchises and Solutions Platform to access more clients. To ensure high levels of client service, our sales teams liaise regularly with product specialists at our Franchises. The specialists are tasked with responding to institutional client and retail inquiries on product performance and educating prospective investors and retail partners in coordination with the relevant internal sales team members. Our distribution and marketing professionals collaborate closely with our Franchises’ product specialists in order to attract new clients while also servicing and generating additional sales from existing clients.

"
58,,". RISK FACTORS. Indebtedness Risks Our substantial indebtedness may expose us to material risks. Capital Structure and Public Company Risks A relatively large percentage of our common stock is concentrated with a small number of shareholders, which could increase the volatility in our stock trading and affect our share price. The market price of our common stock is likely to be volatile and could decline. Future sales of shares by shareholders could cause our stock price to decline. If securities or industry analysts publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. We are an “emerging growth company,” and any decision on our part to comply with certain reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our Common Stock less attractive to investors. The requirements of being a public company may strain our resources and distract our management, which could make it difficult to manage our business, particularly after we are no longer an “emerging growth company.” Failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and stock price Our ability to pay regular dividends is subject to our Board’s discretion and Delaware law. Future offerings of debt or equity securities may rank senior to our common stock. Provisions in our charter documents could discourage a takeover that shareholders may consider favorable. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our shareholders, which could limit our shareholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. Legal and Regulatory Risks As an investment management firm and brokerage firm, we are subject to extensive regulation. The regulatory environment in which we operate is subject to continual change and regulatory developments designed to increase oversight and may materially adversely affect our business. Industry Risks Recent trends in the investment management industry could reduce our AUM, revenues and net income. The investment management industry is intensely competitive. Third Party Risks We depend primarily on third parties to market Victory Funds, USAA Funds and VictoryShares. We rely on third parties to provide products or services for the operation of our business, and a failure or inability by such parties to provide these products or services could materially adversely affect our business. Operational and Cybersecurity Risks Operational risks may disrupt our business, result in losses or limit our growth. Failure to implement effective information and cyber security policies, procedures and capabilities could disrupt operations and cause financial losses. Disruption to the operations of third parties whose functions are integral to our ETF platform may adversely affect the prices at which VictoryShares trade, particularly during periods of market volatility. General Risks Reputational harm could result in a loss of AUM and revenues. If our techniques for managing risk are ineffective, we may be exposed to material unanticipated losses. Certain of our strategies invest principally in the securities of non‑U.S. companies, which involve foreign currency exchange, tax, political, social and economic uncertainties and risks. The expansion of our business outside of the United States raises tax and regulatory risks, may adversely affect our profit margins and places additional demands on our resources and employees. Failure to properly address conflicts of interest could harm our reputation, business and results of operations. Insurance may not be available on a cost-effective basis to protect us from liability.

59,els copy,"els copy.  Integrated Distribution, Marketing and Operations Marketing – Our distribution efforts are supplemented by our marketing function, which is primarily responsible for enhancing the visibility and quality of our portfolio of brands. They are specifically tasked with managing corporate, Franchise and Solutions Platform branding efforts, database management, the development of marketing materials, our website, digital marketplace, digital marketing and social media efforts, and the publishing of white papers. Operations – Our highly centralized operations functions provide our Franchises and Solutions Platform with the support they need so that they can focus on their investment processes. Our Investment Franchises share operating functions such as trading platforms, risk and compliance, middle- and back‑office support, technology, data and analytics, finance, human resources, accounting, and legal. Although our operations are highly centralized, we do allow our Franchises a degree of customization with respect to their desired investment support functions, which we believe helps them maintain their unique investment processes and minimize disruptions. We outsource certain middle‑ and back‑office activities, such as sub-transfer agent, trade settlement, portfolio analytics, custodian reconciliation, portfolio accounting, corporate action processing, performance calculation and client reporting, to scaled, recognized service providers, who provide their services to us on a variable‑cost basis. Systems and processes are customized as necessary to support our investment processes and operations. We maintain relationships with multiple vendors for most of our outsourced functions, which we believe mitigates vendor‑specific risk. We also have cyber and information security, business continuity and data privacy programs in place to help mitigate risk. Outsourcing these functions enables us to grow our AUM, both organically and through acquisitions, without the incremental capital expenditures and working capital that would typically be needed. Under our direction and oversight, our outsourced model enhances our ability to integrate our acquisitions, as we are experienced in working with our vendors to efficiently bring additional Franchises onto our platform in a cost‑efficient manner. We believe both the scalability of our business and our cost structure, in which approximately two‑thirds of our operating expenses are variable, drives industry-leading margins and facilitates free cash flow conversion. Additionally, we believe having most of our expenses tied to AUM and the number of client accounts provides downside margin protection should there be sustained net outflows or adverse market conditions.
