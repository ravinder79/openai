Business History and Organization
Victory Capital Holdings, Inc. was formed in 2013 for the purpose of acquiring Victory Capital Management (“VCM”) and Victory Capital Services, Inc. (“VCS”) from KeyCorp. VCM is a U.S. registered investment adviser (“RIA”) managing assets through open-end mutual funds, institutional separate accounts, CITs, wrap account programs, UCITs, private funds, and ETFs. VCM also provides mutual fund administrative services for the Victory Portfolios, Victory Variable Insurance Funds, and the mutual fund series of the Victory Portfolios II (collectively, the “Victory Funds”), a family of open-end mutual funds; and VictoryShares (the Company’s ETF brand), as well as USAA branded investment products, which includes the USAA Mutual Fund Trust, a family of open-end mutual funds (the “USAA Funds”). In 2021, the Company acquired WestEnd Advisors (“WestEnd”), which maintains its own RIA, which is an affiliate RIA that receives certain services from VCM. VCM employs all of the Company’s United States investment professionals across all 12 Franchises and its Solutions Platform. VCM’s wholly owned subsidiaries include RS Investment Management (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., RS Investments (Hong Kong) Limited, and RS Investments (UK) Limited, Victory Capital Digital Assets, LLC and NEC Pipeline LLC. VCS is registered with the SEC as an introducing broker-dealer and serves as distributor and underwriter for the Victory Funds and USAA Funds and for municipal fund securities issued by the Nevada College Savings Trust Fund under the USAA 529 Education Savings Plan. VCS also serves as placement agent for certain private funds managed by VCM. During the early part of the second quarter of 2023, the Direct Investor Business will be expanded to include brokerage capabilities through VCS. VCH indirectly owns Victory Capital Transfer Agency, Inc. (“VCTA”), a transfer agent registered with the SEC that acts as transfer agent for the USAA Funds.
