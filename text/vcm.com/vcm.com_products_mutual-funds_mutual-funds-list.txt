                The fund’s risk and volatility are based on their investment category assigned by Morningstar. Each category is assigned a risk score on a scale of one to seven, depicted as a bar chart. Preservation of Capital has the lowest volatility level (one) and Very Aggressive as the highest volatility level (seven). Actual results will vary, and the volatility or risk score should not be considered or relied upon as an expected risk level or performance guarantee.

Past performance does not guarantee future results. The performance quoted represents past performance and current performance may be lower or higher. The investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. 


Returns include reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. Performance for periods greater than one year is annualized.


High, double- and triple-digit returns are highly unusual and cannot be sustained. Investors should be aware that these returns were primarily achieved during favorable market conditions.


Fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements were in place for some or all periods shown, without which, fund performance would have been lower.


Net expense ratios reflect contractual fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements currently in effect. Click on the fund name for more detail, including the end date of the fee agreement.

Mutual Funds List

Carefully consider a fund's investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. This and other information can be found in the fund's prospectus or, if available, the summary prospectus, which may be obtained by visiting the Mutual Fund and ETF prospectus pages at vcm.com. Read the prospectus carefully before investing.


All investing involves risk, including potential loss of principal.


Victory Capital means Victory Capital Management Inc., the investment adviser of the Victory Capital mutual funds and USAA Mutual Funds. Victory Capital mutual funds and USAA Mutual Funds are distributed by Victory Capital Services, Inc. (VCS), member FINRA, an affiliate of Victory Capital. Victory Capital and its affiliates are not affiliated with United Services Automobile Association or its affiliates. USAA and the USAA logos are registered trademarks and the USAA Mutual Funds and USAA Investments logos are trademarks of United Services Automobile Association and are being used by Victory Capital and its affiliates under license.


©2022 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or distributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete, or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.


The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or “star rating,” is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed- end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product’s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The Morningstar Rating does not include any adjustment for sales loads. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.


Fund performance used for the rankings reflects certain fee waivers, without which, Morningstar rankings would have been lower and Morningstar ratings may have been lower.
