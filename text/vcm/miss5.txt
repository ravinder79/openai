Equity Incentive Plans
Prior to the Company’s IPO in 2018, equity-based awards were issued to executives, directors and key employees of the Company under the Victory Capital Holdings, Inc. Equity Incentive Plan (the “2013 Plan”) and the Outside Director Equity Incentive Plan (the “Director Plan”).
In connection with the IPO, the Company’s board of directors adopted, and the Company’s stockholders approved, the Victory Capital Holdings, Inc. 2018 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2018 Plan”), and the Victory Capital Holdings, Inc. 2018 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “ESPP Plan”), each of which became effective upon the completion of the IPO. No further grants will be made under the 2013 Plan.
The 2018 Plan authorizes the grant of non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance awards and other awards that may be settled in or based upon shares of the Company’s Common Stock. 
A total of 3,372,484 of Common Stock is available for issuance under the 2018 Plan, as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Company’s board of directors. Shares underlying awards that are settled in cash, expire or are canceled, forfeited or otherwise terminated without delivery to a participant will again be available for issuance under the 2018 Plan. In addition, shares withheld or surrendered in connection with the payment of an exercise price of an award or to satisfy tax withholding will again be available for issuance under the 2018 Plan. As of December 31, 2022, 1,077,591 shares of Common Stock remained available for issuance under the 2018 Plan.
The Compensation Committee of the Company’s board of directors approves the terms and conditions for offerings under the ESPP Plan. A total of 350,388 shares of Common Stock was available for issuance under the ESPP Plan. As of December 31, 2022, 316,905 shares of Common Stock remained available for issuance under the ESPP Plan.
Under the Company’s approved offerings under the ESPP Plan, shares of Common Stock are available for purchase at three month calendar intervals at a 5 percent discount from the market price on the purchase date, which is the last day of each calendar quarter during the six month offering period. Amounts purchased by an individual cannot exceed $25,000 worth of stock in any given calendar year. The ESPP Plan is a non-compensatory plan and includes no option features other than employees may change their contributions or withdraw from the plan once during each six month offering period during a specified time approved by the Company. All U.S.-based employees are eligible to participate in the ESPP.

Share‑based compensation expense for equity awards is measured at the grant date, based on the estimated fair value of the award, and recognized over the requisite employee service period. Stock option awards have a ten year contractual life.
The Company uses the Common Stock closing price on the grant date as the grant date fair value of restricted share awards. For stock option awards, the grant date fair value of stock option awards is computed using Black‑Scholes option pricing framework.

NOTE 17. EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS
The Company maintains a defined contribution 401(k) Plan (the “401(k) Plan”), covering substantially all employees who have met the eligibility requirements. The 401(k) Plan is subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. In 2022, 2021 and 2020 the Company recognized expense of $4.8 million, $4.0 million and $4.7 million in employer matched contributions, respectively.
The Company sponsors a deferred compensation plan for key investment professionals and executives (“Employee DC Plan”) as a means to reward and motivate them. The Company purchases mutual funds as directed by the plan participants to fund its related obligations. Such securities are held in a rabbi trust for the participants, and under the terms of the trust agreement, the assets of the trust are available to satisfy the claims of the Company’s general creditors in the event of bankruptcy.
Effective January 1, 2020, the Company created a deferred compensation plan for non-employee members of our board of directors (the “Director DC Plan”). Benefits payable under the Director DC Plan are payable from the Company’s general assets. Amounts contributed under the Director DC Plan and earnings on those amounts are subject to the claims of the Company’s general creditors. 
Gains and losses from fluctuations in value of deferred compensation plan investments are included in interest income and other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and are offset entirely by the corresponding changes in value of the deferred compensation liability. Changes in the value of the Employee DC Plan and Director DC Plan liabilities are recorded in personnel compensation and benefits and general and administrative expense, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Investments held under both deferred compensation plans are recorded in deferred compensation plan investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.
