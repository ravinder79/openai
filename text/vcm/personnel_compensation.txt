Personnel Compensation and Benefits
2022 compared to 2021 – Personnel compensation and benefits were $238.2 million in 2022, an increase of $3.4 million, or 1.4%, from $234.8 million in 2021 primarily due to an increase in variable costs such as sales-based compensation. Also contributing was an increase in headcount and acquisition and transaction-related compensation as a result of the WestEnd and NEC acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2021. Partially offsetting the increase was a decrease in incentive compensation as a result of a decline in operating results. Salaries, payroll related taxes and employee benefits were $87.8 million and $87.1 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Incentive compensation and equity awards granted to employees and directors were $94.5 million and $17.8 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2022, compared to $109.0 million and $17.6 million, respectively, for the same period in 2021. 
2021 compared to 2020 – Personnel compensation and benefits were $234.8 million in 2021, an increase of $37.7 million, or 19.1%, from $197.2 million in 2020 primarily attributable to an increase in salaries, payroll related taxes and employee benefits, incentive compensation and sales-based compensation due to an increase in headcount and an increase in operating results, resulting in an increase in variable costs such as the incentive compensation pool for employees, sales commissions, and third-party distribution costs.
