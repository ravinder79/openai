Fourth Quarter 2022 Compared with Third Quarter 2022
Revenue decreased 2.8% to $201.5 million, in the fourth quarter, compared with $207.3 million in the third quarter, primarily due to lower average AUM, which decreased 2.7% from $158.9 billion to $154.6 billion. GAAP operating margin contracted 810 basis points in the fourth quarter to 39.5%, down from 47.6% in the third quarter. The decline was primarily driven by a non-cash $10.5 million difference in amounts recorded to change the fair value of consideration payable for acquisitions. Fourth-quarter GAAP net income decreased 28.2% to $52.3 million, down from $72.8 million in the prior quarter. Third quarter net income benefited from a lower than normal tax rate as a result of employees exercising stock options during the period. On a per-share basis, GAAP net income decreased 26.7% to $0.74 per diluted share in the fourth quarter, versus $1.01 per diluted share in the third quarter.
Adjusted net income with tax benefit decreased 12.9% to $74.5 million in the fourth quarter, down from $85.6 million in the third quarter.

Fourth Quarter 2022 Compared with Fourth Quarter 2021
Revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2022 decreased 12.0% to $201.5 million, compared with $229.1 million in the same quarter of 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower average AUM, which decreased 4.7% to $154.6 billion, compared with $162.3 billion in the same quarter last year. Also contributing was a slight decrease in revenue realization due to a change in asset mix as a result of the impact of the WestEnd acquisition.

Operating expenses decreased 12.5% to $121.9 million, compared with $139.3 million in last year’s fourth quarter primarily due to a decrease in acquisition-related costs related to the WestEnd and NEC acquisitions that closed in the fourth quarter of 2021 as well as a decrease in variable operating expenses from lower average AUM and earnings. GAAP operating margin expanded 30 basis points to 39.5% in the fourth quarter, from 39.2% in the same quarter of 2021.

Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022, declined 4.0% to $854.8 million, compared with $890.3 million in the same period of 2021. The decrease was primarily due to lower average AUM and a decrease in revenue realization due to a change in asset mix, partially offset by a full-year of revenue from businesses acquired in 2021.
Operating expenses decreased 11.8% to $455.7 million for year ended December 31, 2022, compared with $516.4 million in 2021 primarily due to a decrease in variable operating expenses from lower average AUM, a decrease in acquisition-related costs related to the WestEnd, NEC and THB acquisitions that closed in 2021, and a non-cash $54.4 million benefit in amounts recorded from the change in fair value of consideration payable for acquisitions.

GAAP net earnings per share increased to $3.81 per diluted share in 2022, up from $3.75 per diluted share in 2021 as a result of fewer weighted average shares outstanding in 2022.
