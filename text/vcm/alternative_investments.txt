Alternative Investments – In 2021, we launched our alternative investments platform with the acquisition of New Energy Capital (“NEC”). We offer both opened-end liquid alternative investments as well as closed-end private funds. Given our multi-faceted distribution channels, combined with our ability to develop investment vehicles to deliver these strategies, we are ideally situated to play a meaningful role in democratizing access to alternative investments for retail investors.
With attractive fee rates, margins, longer capital commitments compared with our liquid products, and less likelihood of being disintermediated by non-active strategies, we remain interested in adding additional alternative investment capabilities. We are committed to maintaining the same guiding principles with alternative Investment Franchises that led to success with our traditional Investment Franchises.
