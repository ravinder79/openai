A message from Chairman and CEO David Brown

Redefining asset management
At Victory Capital, our energy is focused on what matters most: helping our clients and investors meet their investment goals.
To support that mission, we’ve built an innovative, next generation business model that aims to put investment excellence first and deliver real solutions in all market environments.
Since becoming an independent company in 2013, we have expanded by utilizing the specialized expertise of our 12 investment franchises and through a series of strategic acquisitions. Today, we are a publicly traded company with $161.4 billion in assets under management1 and approximately 450 employees across 13 offices, in the U.S. and abroad. We’ve also built a rising ETF and solutions platform that we believe is unique in its approach to helping advance client outcomes. 
A key differentiator for us is that each of our franchises maintains its own investment process and independent voice. This is a deliberate decision that ensures investment autonomy and unique thinking among our investment professionals and empowers them to spend 100% of their time doing what they do best: managing money and serving clients. We surround those franchises with what we consider to be a best-in-class centralized operations and distribution platform that is centralized, but not standardized.

Our model provides a diversified suite of products across asset classes, investment return streams, product types and business channels. When it comes to developing new products, we make those decisions based on investor needs and the expertise of our investment professionals.
Our clients, which include institutions, retirement plans, financial advisors, individuals, and 529 education savings plan account holders, choose to work with us because we’re a specialist money manager that values independent decision-making, and we’re client-focused.
We take it seriously when our clients place their future in our hands. That’s why our current employees have personally invested approximately $200 million2 in our investment products. Moreover, our employees are material owners of our business.
At Victory Capital we work hard, every day, to maintain the trust of our clients and investors by pursuing investment excellence, delivering exceptional service, and seeking better investment outcomes. 
For more insights on our business, I invite you to look around our website. Be sure to follow us on our social media channels as well.
