Social Media Guidelines and Disclosures
Our goal in social media is to deliver timely insight and perspective from our thought leaders and senior management, and to participate in conversation around topics important to advisors and institutions.
Given the regulations governing our industry, below are some important guidelines and disclosures that govern our participation in social channels, and how we interact with you. Please read them carefully.
Comment Guidelines
Victory Capital welcomes the interaction that social media can provide. However, Victory Capital reserves the right to remove and moderate comments. We reserve the right to restrict users who don’t follow these guidelines, who post promotional or offensive content, or for any other reason.
Comments and opinions posted by users are the responsibility of the person who posted them. Victory Capital does not adopt, endorse, or guarantee the accuracy of content posted by others, and such content does not represent the views of Victory Capital. A like or follow is not an endorsement.
Be aware that dispensing financial advice is a regulated activity
General discussions on the market are appropriate, but specific mention of investment testimonials or making a recommendation about our investment products is not permitted.
Stay on topic
Our goal is to host conversation that is relevant and valuable to our audience. To facilitate this, we ask that you keep your comments within the purposes of the posts made on our individual social platforms. Any comment that is clearly off-topic, makes unsupported claims, or promotes unrelated content or spam will be removed.
No personal financial or private information
Keep private or confidential information to yourself. These platforms are public spaces, and common sense should prevail. 
No investment advice
Please refrain from making requests for specific investment advice, recommendations or testimonials. This site is intended as informational only.
Be civil and respectful

Please refrain from inappropriate or abusive language, or personal attacks. This includes but is not limited to profane or provocative language (which means discriminatory, libelous, hateful, racially or ethnically offensive or derogatory content, threats or harassment, obscene or sexually explicit language).


While we welcome constructive criticism and encourage debate, we may also block, in our sole discretion, any commenter who continues to post material contrary to the guidelines set forth above.

No spam
Posts focused on selling a product or service or are promotional in nature may result in our blocking you or reporting such content as spam.
Disclaimers
Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, Twitter, YouTube, and any other social media platform are owned by third parties unaffiliated with Victory Capital. Victory Capital is not responsible for the privacy or security policies at these sites or other third party sites to which they provide further links. For Victory Capital’s privacy policy, please visit the Policies page on www.vcm.com. Please do not post any information you wish to keep private.
Victory Capital does not endorse and is not responsible for any ads, content, products, advice, opinions, recommendations or other material of third party sites that may be promoted via advertising within social media properties. A like or follow is not an endorsement.
Victory Capital reserves the right to change these guidelines at any time at its sole discretion.
Certain views expressed are the author’s, are subject to change without notice, and may differ from those of Victory Capital, Inc.  Information and opinions are derived from proprietary and nonproprietary sources deemed to be reliable; the accuracy of those sources is not guaranteed. This material should not be construed as a recommendation of any security, does not constitute investment advice, and should not be relied upon as such.  Investors should seek independent legal and financial advice, including advice as to tax consequences, before making any investment decision.
Important Information and Risks
Consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the funds and the USAA® 529 Education Savings Plan (Plan) carefully before investing. Download a prospectus or summary prospectus for Victory mutual funds or USAA Mutual Funds or download a prospectus or summary prospectus for the ETFs, containing this and other important information. Download a Plan Description and Participation Agreement containing this and other important information about the Plan from Victory Capital Services, Inc., Underwriter and Distributor. Read it carefully before investing. You should compare the Plan with any 529 Plan offered by your home state or your beneficiary’s home state and consider, before investing, any state tax or other state benefits such as financial aid, scholarship funds, and protection from creditors that are only available for investments in the home state’s plan.  
Past performance does not guarantee future results. Investments involve risk including possible loss of principal. 
ETFs have the same risks as the underlying securities traded on the exchange throughout the day. Redemptions are limited and often commissions are charged on each trade, and ETFs may trade at a premium or discount to their net asset value. There can be no assurance that an active trading market for shares of an ETFs will develop or be maintained. The ETFs are not actively managed and may be affected by a general decline in market segments related to the Indexes. The ETFs invest in securities included in, the Index, regardless of their investment merits. The performance of the ETFs may diverge from that of the Indexes.
Victory Capital means Victory Capital Management Inc., the investment adviser of the Victory Capital mutual funds, USAA Mutual Funds, VictoryShares ETFs, VictoryShares USAA ETFs, and USAA 529 Education Savings Plan (Plan). Victory Capital mutual funds, USAA Mutual Funds, and the Plan are distributed by Victory Capital Services, Inc. (VCS), an affiliate of Victory Capital. VictoryShares ETFs and VictoryShares USAA ETFs are distributed by Foreside Fund Services, LLC (Foreside). VCS and Foreside are members of FINRA. VCS and Victory Capital are not affiliated with Foreside. USAA is not affiliated with Foreside, Victory Capital, or VCS. USAA and the USAA logos are registered trademarks and the USAA Mutual Funds, USAA Investments, and the Plan logos are trademarks of United Services Automobile Association and are being used by Victory Capital and its affiliates under license.
