The deadline to pay federal income taxes is April 18th. While some tax payers file their tax returns early, many wait until the last minute. And lots of people file extensions to get their taxes done after the regular deadline. Whether you file promptly or procrastinate, here are some ideas on how to make things flow smoothly.

These Forms Help you Organize Income
Whether you prepare your own return or use the services of a professional, you can improve the efficiency of the process with a little organization.
Some of the forms to help you calculate your top-line income include:

1099s and W2s from all sources
K-1s from any partnerships you own, either public or private
Bank and brokerage statements

If you have any questions about any of these items, the IRS is a good resource for answers. If your return is complicated, you should seek the advice of licensed tax preparer or CPA.
Forms you Receive to Report Deductions

If you pay interest on a home loan, you’ll receive a 1098 from the lender.
You’ll get a 1098E if you have a student loan.

Documents to Keep if you Itemize Deductions
If any of the following apply to you, ask your tax preparer or CPA which of these documents you’ll need to complete your return.

Loan documents if you borrowed money to buy a house
Receipts for unreimbursed business expenses
Receipts if you moved for a change in duty station
Receipts for medical, dental, and prescriptions expenses not paid from your HSA account
Receipts for dental, health, or long-term care insurance not included in payroll deductions
Log books of miles driven for work or medical care
Property tax bills for real estate you own
State income tax bills
DMV fees
Police reports & insurance correspondence if you had a casualty loss
Receipts for charitable contributions you made (in cash or kind)
Receipts for investment Fees
Receipts for tax preparation fees
Receipts for union dues
Receipts for professional dues and trade publications

If you work in a trade that requires tools, they may be deductible, so it is a good practice to hold onto receipts and cancelled checks for these types of items. The same applies for safety shoes you may have bought for work.
If you’re a teacher, certain items you bought for the classroom may be deductible. So, hold on to credit card receipts or cancelled checks for those. And check with your tax preparer or CPA to confirm exactly what you can claim.
Other Paperwork to Hold Onto
Keep your 1040-ES if you made quarterly tax payments. If you use online banking, consider downloading last year’s account activity. You can use this as a final review to search for other income you may have missed or expenses that may be deductible.
Your employer will likely send you a healthcare coverage statement (Form 1095) around the time you get your W2. Ask your CPA or tax preparer if it needs to accompany your return when you file it.
