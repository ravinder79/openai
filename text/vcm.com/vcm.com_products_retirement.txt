What is an IRA?
An individual retirement account (IRA) helps you save for retirement with tax advantages that other types of accounts may not have. Once you open an IRA, you can invest the money you contribute in a wide variety of mutual funds, including target retirement funds. Use this tool to compare a traditional IRA with a taxable account.
