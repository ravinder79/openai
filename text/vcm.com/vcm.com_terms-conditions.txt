Cookies
Cookies enable Victory to better understand how you and others use our online channels. They allow us to collect information about where your browser goes on our websites. This information assists us in understanding your preferences and improving our website. For example, the information we obtain from cookies or GIFs (Graphical Interchange Format) helps us understand whether our customers use certain website features and how to improve navigation. We also may use information gathered as the result of GIFs or cookies to target emails or website messages. Knowing where your browser has been on our website helps us present more useful information to you. We do not sell this or any other information about you to other websites or firms. Unless you have affirmatively consented, we do not provide any personally identifiable information about you to anyone else for their marketing purposes. 
Victory uses cookies that fall into two categories: persistent and session-based.

Persistent cookies remain on your computer after you've closed your browser or turned off your computer. They include a unique identifier for your browser that only Victory can read and use, and that tells us you are a customer or prior website visitor. We are especially careful about the security and confidentiality of the information we send through persistent cookies. For example, we do not store account numbers or passwords in persistent cookies.
Session cookies exist only during an online session with Victory. They disappear from your computer when you close your browser software or turn off your computer. Session cookies allow you to conduct transactions or request your own personal or account information on our website. They contain encrypted or encoded information about your account(s), and/or identifying information that you have previously provided to us. This information allows Victory to process your online transactions and request.

While Victory takes reasonable steps to ensure the security and integrity of information you submit to us, no security system is perfect, and electronic communications, in particular, are susceptible to interception by third parties. Accordingly, Victory makes no representations, warranties, or assurances that transmissions to and from the Site are secure.
